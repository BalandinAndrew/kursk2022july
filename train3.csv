"Good afternoon ! Applied in May 2021 for an increased allowance from 3 to 7 years for her first child, who turned 4 in March 2021. A refusal came, although according to all my calculations it should have been approved. The reason given in the refusal is that the first reason is that it exceeds income, the second reason is that an able-bodied family member does not work, that is, I am. I now explain my position. The reason exceeds income: is a child born in April 2021 considered in the calculations, and payments from 3 to 7 years are included in the amount when calculating the living wage? If not, then we have to go through the amount of income for 4 people in the family - my husband's salary for the past year was about 300 thousand, I received unemployment payments from April to September, this is about 30 thousand rubles, and benefits from 3 to 7 years from March to January is about 55 thousand. even taking the amount to the maximum, I didn’t manage to reach 4, which exceeds the subsistence minimum, taking into account benefits from 3 to 7 years. The second reason for refusal is a non-working family member. In March, the eldest child turned 3 years old, sat with him until 3 years old, in April until September she was at the labor exchange, in September she was registered for pregnancy? Whose right? And now my husband is unemployed.",10,Another

"I ask for help in protecting the rights of residents of houses on 2 and 4 Gagarin Street in the city of Kursk. The fact is that in the former shopping complex ""Kurskie Zori"", located between the indicated houses, the ""Magnit"" store was opened, and a metal unloading platform was built in the courtyard of these houses. The unloading of goods after the opening of the Magnit store interferes with residents whose windows overlook the courtyard. Arrangement of an unloading platform in the yard of our houses violates the legislation of the Russian Federation.

Paragraph 3.7 of SanPiN 2.1.2.2645-10 clarifies that it is not allowed to load products or other materials into public premises from the side of the house, where there are entrances to apartments and windows of residential premises. Everyone is obliged to comply with the norms of SanPiN: paragraph 3 of Art. 39 of the Federal Law of March 30, 1999 No. 52-FZ “On the sanitary and epidemiological well-being of the population”, which states that compliance with the sanitary rules approved in the prescribed manner is mandatory for both citizens and organizations.",13,Another

"Hello. It was necessary to write this letter. We write anonymously, because We worry about the fate of the children. There is simply no strength to endure and worry about our children who study at the MBOU school No. 2 in Kursk, in the 4th “b” grade. Class teacher Bezhan Tatyana Konstantinovna. To call her a teacher, and even more so a teacher-psychologist, does not turn the tongue. We do not know how such an “employee” was allowed to enter primary school. At the end of the 4th grade, children will leave with a crippled psyche. And these are not empty words. Children constantly have to be persuaded to go to school, spend hours on it and calm them down. The associations of children with the school are the constant cries of the teacher. How is that possible? Bezhan T.K. regularly insults children, calls them “fools”, “morons”, “children of drunks” (all verbatim) and the list goes on. All parents will attest to this. He constantly yells at children, saying that they are not capable of anything and that they belong in a school for the mentally retarded. And we all know what kind of school it is. Does the primary school teacher really not understand that the child's psyche suffers? The question, of course, is rhetorical… Bezhan T.K. regularly disrupts classes, although the children have congenital malformations, for which there is absolutely no preparation! Several times a week, she cancels math, Russian, and other important classes. Instead, she conducts “explanatory”, as she believes, conversations with the children. With screams. Speaking with girls - about ""prostitutes"", and with boys - about ""convicts"". This is literally one of the examples. Discuss prostitution in 4th grade! What's going on in this teacher's head? Which believes that it is more important to discuss prostitution and the criminal world than to prepare children for CD. Once again, we want to focus on this - there is absolutely no preparation of children for CM. During the distance learning period, the classes were held as follows - in the morning the teacher sent a photo of a leaflet with what needed to be done, and in the evening the parents sent photos of the children's work. That's all. Is this what we were striving for? Is this our worthy education? Yesterday Bezhan T.K. went even further. She made the children stand 2 lessons. Remember, this is 4th grade. The children stood for two lessons and listened to educational conversations and cries ... instead of knowledge. And far from all the facts are described in this open letter. We ask you to deal with this situation, take this teacher under control, and better the whole school, because continue learning in it there is no desire. These words can be confirmed anonymously by all parents. Anonymous, because many are worried about the possible “bullying” of children.",7,Another

"Hello, we all write and talk about only one thing: roads, hospitals, bad government, and so on. I have been following the communities of Kursk for a couple of years, but I have never seen anyone write and complain about mobile operators. In the cities of the Kursk region, there is practically no issue in servicing cellular communications, but the quality of service could still be improved in the 21st century. The problem appears at the exits from the city, namely on the highways of the region. Many friends are faced with such a problem: it is possible to get through only to number 112 and that's it. WHY IS THIS HAPPENING? We will not talk about any specific sections of roads, there is such a problem everywhere. Take, for example, roads such as: Kursk - Zheleznogorsk, Kursk - Oboyan, Kursk - Shchigry, Kursk - Lgov - Rylsk, Kursk - Sudzha, leaving Kursk in any direction, we are facing the communication problem of any operator `NO NETWORK`. Verified by personal experience. When we go, for example, in the direction of Moscow - St. Petersburg, the network is everywhere and always. The Kursk region is still making roads, repairing hospitals, etc. While someone is now standing on the road with a broken tire and cannot get through, or even worse, someone has become ill at the wheel and also cannot get through to their relatives and loved ones.

"Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin spoke more than once about the revival of villages. In the Zheleznogorsk district of the Kursk region, a merger of village councils took place. On the territory of the united Linetsky village council there are many villages, villages, farms, which are widely scattered within a radius of 7-15 km. Therefore, during the years of Soviet power, several schools were built on the territory of the united village councils. Years passed, young people from the village left for the city. There are few children left, and only 3 schools remain (Radubezhskaya secondary school, Linetskaya secondary school, Nizhnezhdanovskaya secondary school). The villages of the former Nizhnezhdanovsky s / s are the most remote from the regional center. The former leadership of the Fatezhsky district, which owned the Nizhnezhdanovsky and Linetsky s / s, set the task of reviving the villages. For this purpose, a village was built, gas was supplied, in 2007 (now s / s belonged to the Zheleznogorsk district) a new school was built. Everything in it meets modern requirements. There is a computer class, a workshop, a gym, a dining room are equipped. With the help of children and teachers at the school, a museum of military and labor glory of our fellow villagers was opened, a gallery of the Immortal Regiment was created. Children help take care of the monument to the fallen fellow villagers and know for sure that no one is forgotten and nothing is forgotten. Some graduates remained to serve in the Army on a contract basis, and are currently participating in a military special operation in the Donbass. And everything seemed to work out, young families with children settled in the village. But two schools of the Linetsky s / s were closed (Radubezhskaya secondary school and Linetskaya secondary school). A bus was allocated and children from these schools were taken to the new Nizhnezhdanovsk secondary school. In the 2022-2023 academic year, 51 children of the Linetsky s / s, out of 8 first-graders, should study here. And suddenly the Head of the Administration of the Zheleznogorsk region, Frolkov A.D. makes a decision on the reorganization of the school, referring to the instruction of the Education Committee of the Kursk region, where, allegedly, a decision was made to liquidate 5 schools of the Zheleznogorsk district. They want to expel the children, but where is the new building? Sell? Young families with children are outraged, many of them came to the village of Verkhnee Zhdanovo only because there is a school here. How is it possible to close all the schools of the united village councils and the theme is to cross out everything that has been done under the program for the revival of the village. Is our country really so poor that it cannot afford the maintenance of even one school in the territory of the united village councils. So the revival of the villages for the Linetsky s / s has ended, no school means no future. And in the village of Verkhnee Zhdanovo, the House of Culture, a kindergarten, and a post office have already been closed. Probably, the management wants to close the school in order to finally destroy the village. We, the residents of the Linetsky village council, appeal to you with a request: do not let our villages be destroyed, help defend our school.",7,Another

This problem has existed for several months. My repeated appeals to the 112 service partially solve this problem (they transmit this information and the coverage appears but not always).

"Good afternoon. On July 19, 2021, I was sent to undergo training and receive additional education in the direction of the public employment service at the Kursk Regional Center for Training and Retraining of Housing and Utilities Personnel as a boiler operator. From the date of registration for unemployment until July 27, I was actively looking for work (I have three children and it is simply not possible to live on one allowance). On July 28, 2021, I officially got a job. In accordance with the law of the Russian Federation, when an unemployed citizen is sent for vocational training, he is considered employed. If during this period an unemployed citizen independently found a job, but continues vocational training (regularly attends classes, fulfills the scope of the curriculum), The employment of a citizen while undergoing training in the direction of the employment service is not a basis for expelling the student and returning the scholarship. On August 2, in my personal account on the website of the Committee on Labor and Employment of the Kursk Region, I found an order dated 07/27/2021 on deregistration.

They consulted in detail and took my contacts for a possible solution to the issue. I believe my rights have been violated.

"Good afternoon, Roman Vladimirovich! I would like to address you with the following question: why do you and your colleagues consider the extension of non-working days appropriate? The fact that children do not go to kindergarten and school? Are shopping malls closed? So the parents of these children go to grocery stores, use public transport, visit guests and bring the virus home ... In our area, the standard of living is already very low, and you want it to become even lower? Where else? Due to the fact that shopping centers are now closed, prices for clothes and shoes have been raised in online stores, and now, excuse me, is the season! Not to mention us adults, you need to dress and shoe your children! And at these prices, which are now present on the sites, it is almost impossible! Distance education for schoolchildren is just a quest! Children simply cannot perceive information at home on their own, And many parents are not teachers by their very nature! What are you trying to achieve by extending the weekend? I believe that we can limit ourselves to more mild restrictions, such as the closure of food courts, catering, fitness rooms, entertainment, and any public events. And what you and your colleagues are doing, I consider a simple mockery of ordinary people! Hope for understanding",6,Another

Almost all the residents of the district, in conversations with each other, thought and rejoiced that the construction of the FOKOT would take place there. Thus, this territory will be ennobled and a center of attraction will appear in the center of the village, because there is a park nearby, Klykov Avenue, a recreation center, a police department that could keep order and much more, BUT the joy did not last long and caring people from the district administration said that the construction of FOKOT would take place in d. Volzhanets and they are extremely dissatisfied with the location of FOKOT, but asked to remain incognito so as not to experience problems at work and asked that this decision of the district authorities be made public. In the village of Kshensky there are about 6000 people according to the data for 2020 from Wikipedia, and in the village of Volzhanets about 1000 for 2010, is it really unclear where the FOKOT should be located ????

Thousands of talented guys will not be able to physically go to train in the Volzhansky s / s, no one argues that every s / s should have sports grounds, but each site must correspond to the local population.

"I, Svetlana Dmitrievna Matyukhova, am writing to you in connection with the current situation in our family, namely, the difficult financial situation. Our family consists of 4 people, in which 2 twin children, born in 2018, are forced to live on the same salary of a spouse who works in the Federal Penitentiary Service of Russia in the Kursk Region (we fit the category of beneficiaries), my husband has to go to work and a second job it is forbidden. I can't go to work there is no one to leave the children with, my mother is a disabled person of the 2nd group at heart, we don’t have more close relatives in Kursk, we can’t hire a nanny or send the children to a private kindergarten for financial reasons, about 60% of my husband’s salary goes to pay off mortgage lending and utility bills., it is very difficult for a family with 2 small children to live on the remaining amount. In this regard, I ask you to consider the candidacies of my children Matyukhova Polina Pavlovna born on 21.09.2018. and Matyukhov Konstantin Pavlovich born on September 21, 2018 for enrollment in kindergarten No. 11. located at the address: Kursk, A. Deriglazov Ave., 27; kindergarten No. 19 (Kursk, A. Deriglazov Ave., 53A), kindergarten No. 20 (Kursk, A. Deriglazova Ave., 27B), kindergarten No. 15 (Kursk, A. Deriglazov Ave., 67), kindergarten No. 21 (Kursk, Podvodnikov St., 15) so that I can get a job and help our family financially. We are in all of the above gardens in the queue since birth, but did not make it to the enrollment list for the 2020 enrollment. At the moment, in different kindergartens, according to the queue number, we are from 200 to 460 (this year, due to the situation with the Covid-19 virus, we confirmed the queue by phone, therefore, there are no notices with queue numbers on hand, only verbally). Unfortunately, there is no opportunity to carry 2 children alone to more remote areas of the city in our car, we use public transport, and risk the health of children, in the morning and in the evening in minibuses packed to capacity and buses (sometimes with transfers!), there is no desire, and the daughter also does not tolerate the road very well (she is constantly motion sick).
