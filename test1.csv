I was consulted on a set of necessary documents and was told to call back when all the documents and their copies are ready, to sign up for the submission of documents.

There was a social contract only for job search and individual entrepreneur. I understand that there were a lot of applications, the quota ended too quickly. But why is the work of the committee in this direction structured in such a way that they send documents to collect, and do not write them down immediately as they are requested ??? It turns out that I, a mother of two children, on maternity leave, instead of the support I need in the form of a social contract, I get a refusal and several hundred rubles of copying costs (2 copies of each document!). Was it really impossible to immediately register people as they applied for the submission of documents and then analyze the funds remaining under the quota??? And not to encourage, and then refuse! Especially, that the registration for the submission of domains was carried out approximately with a two-week gap from the date of application. This is that everything was done on purpose: first spread information about such a measure of support from everywhere, and then report that there is no money left, are you late???

For three months in 2021, I received only insulin, the doctor does not prescribe needles at all, test strips I was discharged once, but they are still not available in the pharmacy. Twice a week I call the pharmacy on my own or come, but the pharmacy answers that there are no strips according to my prescription. Very little has been purchased and is given to those who were previously on the waiting list. I consider this fact a gross violation of the law. My life is constantly put in danger, because I have to give insulin injections to my eye, not knowing what my blood sugar level is. I do not officially work, I take care of a disabled child who is not yet three years old. I don't have a disability. There is no own money to buy test strips."

I would like that this year there would be more Christmas decorations, so that it would be even more beautiful and elegant. I understand that the budget of the city is not very large to beautifully decorate the Christmas tree, but let's take the example of other cities. For example, in other cities, they send appeals to local entrepreneurs and enterprises to donate Christmas balls and decorations, we have enough entrepreneurs, so let them chew and smoke at least 3 large Christmas balls, if you collect 3 Christmas balls from each, it will be enough . It would also be possible to hold such an action “Give a toy to the city”, any resident could give a New Year's toy and these toys could decorate Christmas trees near the Central Department Store, there is nothing wrong with that, after all, people will bring Christmas decorations so that it would be nice to go out to the center and take a walk. In order to diversify life in our city, residents must also take part in this. It would be possible to stretch flags with New Year's staff between the trees along with garlands, our city can be made very beautiful, but this requires an active position both on your part and on the part of the residents, I think that a resident of our city will support my initiative too. I really wanted to decorate the New Year's tree in the micro-sugar plant, a very beautiful Christmas tree grows there and it could also be dressed up.

The crossing of tram tracks is carried out in places where there are no railings, including at the pedestrian crossing marked with marking 1.14.1. Recently, in the morning hours, when the movement of pedestrians through this area in the direction of the public transport stop `Zapolnaya Street`, to the place of work or to the City Polyclinic No. 5 is quite intense, the sections where the pedestrian paths intersect with the tram tracks are blocked by cables and other portable metal fences. These fences are supposedly installed by employees of the Europe-40 shopping center, which interferes with the movement of pedestrians, and there is a threat of injury to pedestrians. If a healthy person, noticing this fence in time, can bypass it, and step over the cable, then elderly or visually impaired people, who, due to the location of the City Polyclinic No. Besides, these fences completely exclude the possibility of movement from Studencheskaya Street in the direction of 50 Let Oktyabrya and Zalnaya Streets for people with limited mobility and pedestrians driving prams. According to Article 12.33 of the Code of Administrative Offenses of the Russian Federation, deliberate interference in traffic entails the imposition of an administrative fine on legal entities in the amount of three hundred thousand rubles. Pursuant to article 267 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation, deliberate obstruction of traffic and pedestrians on the road network, if these acts have endangered the life, health and safety of citizens or the threat of destruction or damage to the property of individuals and (or) legal entities, is punishable by a fine in the amount of one hundred thousand to three hundred thousand rubles, as well as imprisonment. At the same time, the term of imprisonment is determined by the degree of harm to health. You need to install,"

322,Another,"Good afternoon! Near the school number 54 on weekdays it is simply impossible to pass because of the cars at the time when the school starts and ends the lessons. And most do not stop at dropping off passengers in the yard and leaving, but go straight to the school on a road that is no longer a carriageway. A huge number of people walking along this road are forced to keep clear, cars almost run into the heels of first-graders, if a child rides a scooter, they will simply knock him down. At the same time, cars drive not only from the side of the yard, but also right along the alley leading from the public transport stop and along the road passing between the school and kindergarten No. 120. As a result, the road surface deteriorates. The car is parked right on the lawn, on which there is simply no grass left because of this and all the curbs are lopsided. During periods of rain, the entire alley and the entrance to the school are covered with mud, it is simply impossible for pedestrians to walk. Cars are also parked directly under the fence of the kindergarten site. At the same time, those who park, who turn on loud music, who throw bulls from the car window into the garden. Not only those who take their children to school, garden and just go to work through this place suffer from this, but also the residents of the houses standing there, because they are forced to live in this disgusting and go to the store along a dirty sidewalk that looks like a country road after rain . and is unsafe and slippery, especially for the elderly. And children riding scooters and bicycles are constantly in danger because of passing cars. The problem is not new, it has already been repeatedly addressed to the authorities. The stumbling block is that in the event of a complete closure of travel on these roads to the kindergarten and school, official vehicles or ambulances, if necessary, will not be able to pass. After all, you can not block the passage completely, but leave the possibility of entry for official cars, for example, by installing a barrier or in another way. Entrances not intended for transport can be blocked completely, especially where the alley passes. So that cars do not park on lawns, trees and bushes can be planted, which will also help to ennoble the territory. The measures taken earlier are absolutely ineffective, raids carried out by the traffic police do not give results and there are no fewer cars. In this regard, I ask you to take a responsible approach to solving the problem with the passage of cars to this territory, to make effective decisions on the organization of passage, and not just “put a tick” on resolving this issue."

1069,Another,"Our son, Stepanov Matvey Nikolaevich, is a second-grade student of the secondary school with in-depth study of individual subjects No. 56 in the city of Kursk, whose class teacher is Yulia Pavlovna Smirnova. Throughout the first year of our son's first grade, we felt pressure from the class teacher due to persistent requests to donate money to the school fund for certain needs. Such requests were stated by the class teacher, both in the general chat of parents and in individual messages. In support of our arguments, I state the facts reflected in the correspondence with the class teacher, and attach a screenshot of the messages. So, on August 17, 2020, I received a personal message from Yulia Pavlovna with the following content: “In Kursk, parents provide financial assistance to the school on a voluntary basis , but there is also a team of parents who should be friendly. Therefore, I urge you to accept the traditions.” Further, on 11/24/2020, Yulia Pavlovna received a message “Please, I beg you to donate 400 rubles for the first half of the year to the school fund by December 10.” To my question why and whether this act is voluntary, Yulia Pavlovna replied that this was the director's request. My husband and I did not mind donating the amount of 1000 rubles, like other parents, to the class fund, and we were convinced that the finances were with the members of the parent committee and they were managed by common agreement. However, on 12/03/2020, from correspondence in the general chat of parents, my husband and I learned that the parent committee was not elected at the general parent meeting, but was appointed from among the parents by the class teacher - Yulia Pavlovna, and the class fund money is with her , instead of the parent committee, the class teacher manages the money, giving instructions to the members of the parent committee. Based on this, we had to make a decision to donate money only for what we consider necessary ourselves, without coercion, the husband informed Yulia Pavlovna personally about this decision. In addition, my husband also wrote about our decision regarding the donation of funds in the general chat of the parents, after once again it was proposed to raise money for the repair of the class in the amount of 2000 rubles from each family. On March 18, 2021, my husband, Nikolai Nikolaevich Stepanov, wrote in a general parent chat: “Definitely against these fees. The school is not private, classroom maintenance is the responsibility of the school administration. Dear parents, don't waste your money. I am ready to personally raise this issue with the administration and seek its implementation. When solving minor cosmetic repairs, he is ready to participate in their elimination both physically and financially. Later, the husband turned to the school administration, director Savenkov A.A. At the meeting, the issue of repairing the heating system in the classroom and repairing the classroom itself was raised. The director said that the repair of the heating system will take control and solve it, but he sees no reason for repairing the classroom and believes that this is not necessary. Despite the fact that we had previously informed the class teacher about our position against collecting funds from our parents and specifically from our family, on 07/08/2021 I received a message from the class teacher: “Hello, Elena Gennadievna. I ask you to provide charitable material assistance to the school, namely to our class, for the repair of the office where your son Matvey studies. All parents of children in our class have already done this, and the office is being renovated. Unfortunately, the state does not finance the school in full, parents have to be sponsors of their own free will. On September 1, you came to a clean class, this was done by the parents of the 4th grade, for a year the wallpaper, linoleum, etc. came off and got dirty in the office. Whose children did this, we will not find out, but it is simply necessary for the entire team of parents to clean up, in which everyone except you agreed. I would very much like your family to participate in this and not be separated from the team. Hope you heard me. All the best."" I wrote an answer: “Yulia Pavlovna, hello! We had a conversation with the director, and suggested that we contact the education committee with a request for repairs. The director told us that there were no grounds for repairing our class. Unfortunately, I can’t do charity work now, because our family has enough worries, you know that our family has many children, besides, our grandmother had an operation. I feel pressure in such words as (everyone except you, did not move away from the team, I hope you heard me, etc.) such manipulation is unpleasant to me. Please, I want to make my own decisions about spending my personal budget. How did you know that we are separating from the collective? Is this your personal belief? All the best."" Yulia Pavlovna continued to correspond with “Hello, Elena. Why are you silent? When are you coming for cleaning? Do not write anything in the group, this is how participation in the team is known. In the schools of our city, parents do the cleaning for their children in the summer, because the cleaners are on vacation. Write in the group the answer to my question. Further, the correspondence with Yulia Pavlovna looked like this: [20.07, 10:19] Elena Stepanova: Hello Yulia Pavlovna. I have a feeling of pressure on your part, I feel discomfort from this. I am not in the city during the summer holidays and my vacation. Check the group of parents, my answer is there. [07/20, 10:45] Yulia Pavlovna: What do you suggest? Am I the only one moving cabinets? Wash, clean for all children? I'm also on vacation. [07/20, 10:47] Yulia Pavlovna: Pankova in the group offered to pay the cleaning company. You didn't answer. What do you think? [07/20, 10:50] Yulia Pavlovna: Acceptance of the school on August 1, the office should be clean. All teachers ask parents to help with this. And parents of other classes come together to clean up, but what about us? What pressure? [07/20, 13:55] Elena Stepanova: Yulia Pavlovna, please tell me where it says that each parent is required to answer questions in chats that are not related to the educational process? I feel pressure from you, I'm not comfortable. You can offer anything, this does not mean that we are obliged to agree to respond to all proposals, etc. Why are you writing to me about this? About your assumptions? I ask you not to interfere in our relationship with our parents and not to speculate. Parents are not required to pay for the maintenance and protection of buildings, cleaning companies and equipment for the educational process. The Parents' Committee has the right to decide on the collection of money only in relation to themselves, and not to the parents of all children. Your goal? Why are you asking me all these questions? On 08/06/2021, a message appeared in the general parent chat from a member of the parent committee “Girls, good afternoon. Class renovation completed. All handed over money except for the Stepanovs. There was money left from the repair, we are going to buy birthday gifts for children. Girls, offer what we will buy for our children at the rate of 200-250 rubles per child. I wrote a message to the chat: “Elena, what exactly did you want to say with a public message in the chat, calling our last name ??? I ask you to remove our last name in your message. I feel discrimination, there is a desire to write to the prosecutor's office about pressure and voluntarily forced offers to donate money for the needs of the school, class. I think I have enough resources for this, both emotional and informational. Please do not single out our family from the whole team. Let me remind you that DELIVERY OF MONEY IS A VOLUNTARY DECISION OF A PARENT, ONLY IN RELATION TO YOURSELF AND YOUR CHILD, THE PARENT COMMITTEE DOES NOT DECIDE IT. You know the situation in my family, the reasons, Why did we decide not to hand over the money? If not, you can ask your class teacher. We respect every opinion and decision of the parents in our class, and we ask you to respect our decision. And don't publish our last name publicly in your posts."" After these messages, I was removed from the general chat of parents, where all issues related to our children and the class were discussed, and Yulia Pavlovna also deleted my husband and I from the chat where she sent information related to education. Now we do not have the opportunity to read all the messages regarding the beginning of the school year and the educational process in the second grade, where our son will study. Thanks to such actions of the class teacher, we were made outcasts in the class, depriving us of the opportunity to have the necessary information about the beginning of the school year. We believe that the class teacher created an unhealthy atmosphere in the classroom by putting pressure on parents to raise funds. Communicating with parents, it became clear to us that many of them have the same feelings as we do in relation to the behavior of the class teacher in this matter, but they are afraid to fall out of favor with her so that her attitude does not affect the children. We believe that such a financially unhealthy mood of the class teacher contradicts not only the norms of pedagogical ethics, but also violates the norms provided for by the Constitution of the Russian Federation, the law ""On Education"". Article 43 of the Constitution of the Russian Federation guarantees citizens the right to public access and free general education in state or municipal educational institutions. As stated in the letter of the Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation dated September 9, 2015 N VK-2227/08 ""On the Prevention of Illegal Collections of Funds"", in accordance with Article 5 of the Federal Law of December 29, 2012 N 273-FZ `On education in the Russian Federation` (hereinafter referred to as the Federal Law), the state guarantees to citizens the general availability and free of charge in accordance with the federal state educational standards of preschool, primary general, basic general, secondary general education. According to paragraph 3 of Part 1 of Article 8 of the Federal Law, ensuring state guarantees for the exercise of the rights to receive public and free preschool education in municipal preschool educational organizations, public and free preschool, primary general, basic general, secondary general education in municipal general educational organizations, providing additional education for children in municipal general educational organizations by providing subventions to local budgets, including labor costs, the purchase of textbooks and teaching aids, teaching aids, games, toys (except for the costs of maintaining buildings and paying utility bills). services), in accordance with the standards determined by the state authorities of the constituent entities of the Russian Federation, falls within the competence of the state authorities of the constituent entities of the Russian Federation in the field of education. In this way, the establishment and collection of fees from parents (legal representatives) of students of general educational organizations for educational services and other activities provided within the limits of the relevant federal state educational standard, the financial provision of which is carried out at the expense of the budgetary appropriations of the relevant budget of the Russian Federation, directly contradicts the legislation of the Russian Federation. Parents of students (pupils) are not required to finance activities for the maintenance and protection of buildings of educational institutions, logistics and equipment of the educational process. Any initiative group of citizens, including the parent committee, the board of trustees and other self-government bodies of the educational institution, have the right to make a decision to contribute (collect) funds only in relation to themselves (members of the committee, board of trustees), and not the parents of all children attending this institution. Based on the foregoing, we ask you to: Carry out an appropriate check regarding the facts set forth in the appeal, based on the results of which give us an explanation. Oblige the class teacher of the 2nd class Smirnova Yulia Pavlovna to restore us in parent chats, where information regarding the educational process is reported. Oblige the class teacher of the 2nd class hold a parent meeting of the class to elect a parent committee in accordance with the requirements of the law."

It became beautiful on the theater square after the renovation, but it’s impossible to be there due to the fact that 10 songs have not been changed for several years, it’s not like sitting on a bench and relaxing, it’s already sickening to pass by these songs.

I paid the fine, even though the violation was forced. Koltsova Street is a one-way street, there are very few parking spaces, and many more visitors. People park on both sides of the street at the edge of the carriageway, but this does not interfere with the passage of vehicles, because. the remaining unoccupied central part of the road ensures unhindered passage of vehicles. I ask you to resolve the issue of increasing the number of parking spaces for hospital visitors within walking distance, or at least remove the “No Stopping” sign. he does not solve the problem - people are forced to park in violation of traffic rules and, in addition to their expenses for the treatment of a child, they also receive expenses in the form of fines. >> End quote At the moment, the street has become a tool for collecting fines. No specific solutions were proposed, but replies were received in the form of a declaration of intention to do something. Please consider my application on the merits, indicating the specific timing of the planned activities for the object indicated in the appeal. In support of the possibility of dismantling the prohibition signs, I am attaching a photo of my violation of the parking rules (my car is the first on the left). Looking closely at the photo, an ambulance can be seen in the background, unhindered by cars parked on both sides of the road. In this way, dismantling the sign will not affect the passage of special vehicles and does not require any significant funds for dismantling. It is only necessary to agree on a change in the Road Traffic Management Project, which could be done from May of this year if there is a desire to be useful and treat requests informally."

There is a recording of the conversation) for advice on the timing of registration (in my case, extension) of benefits for the first child under 3 years old. In the terms announced by the MFC consultant (in February, since my child turned 1 year old on March 08, 2021), I provided all the necessary documents to extend the allowance. Subsequently, I received a call from an employee from the Social Protection Committee, during which I was informed that I had violated the deadlines for submitting documents and that I was denied benefits. In the future, I re-applied to the MFC with the next set of documents to extend the allowance. And similarly, on a call from an employee of the social protection committee, I receive an oral denial of benefits due to excess income at the time of the application. When I applied in February, my family's income allowed me to qualify for this benefit. I believe that the terms were deliberately shifted to me in violation of the law. Since no refusal was given to me in writing. No reference was provided to the regulatory document, according to which there were grounds for refusal. Thus, the rights of my family in receiving benefits for the first child under 3 years old are violated. I ask you to understand the current situation, give written explanations about the deadlines for submitting documents for processing benefits, the calculation procedure (with an explanation of income taken into account for calculating) in accordance with the law with reference to regulatory documents. I don’t have the opportunity to attach confirming photos, since (I repeat) all the actions of the employees of the social committee."

Unfortunately, passengers tear the tint and there is no escape from this kid, it is very difficult for the carrier to keep track of each passenger. I hope that the carrier will understand me correctly and tint the cars, after all, in these minibuses people have to travel 2 hours from Kursk to Lgov.
