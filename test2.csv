In terrible unsanitary conditions, without the necessary equipment and electricity! In the literal sense of the word, my father shone a flashlight from his phone into his mouth for a doctor to have his tooth removed! HOW, HOW - is it possible in the 21st century? Why isn't anyone taking care of this? No equipment, tools from the 20th century, no lighting, nothing to provide a quality service. This is not for you to close playgrounds in covid! Why is there no oversight? When was the last time you checked? How is this hospital funded? Please urgently look into this situation! There are no licenses for surgical intervention in private dentistry in this city. It is only in this dentistry! And God alone knows what might happen after such a procedure in unsanitary conditions. I look forward to hearing from you soon, and most importantly, action! Just do your job and show that you don't eat your bread in vain!"

Applications for placing children on the waiting list are accepted through the Public Services Portal. In October, I submitted an application (through the portal) and the child was placed in a queue indicating its number. To confirm the queue, in March 2021, I made a phone call to MBDOU No. 5, where they explained to me that the reception of citizens is still not conducted, my child is enrolled in the queue, but her number differs by 40 people (increased by 40). The representative of MBDOU No. 5 explained that the number on the portal does not match the actual one and I will be given a notification with a new queue. In accordance with the resolution of the Head of Kursk dated August 9, 2017 No. 2095, all queue data is entered into a single electronic system.

On 06/30/21, after repeated unsuccessful attempts, I finally got through to the Committee of Social Protection of the Population to clarify information on a social contract for the purchase of clothing, furniture and other goods for the low-income. I was consulted on a set of necessary documents and was told to call back when all the documents and their copies are ready, to sign up for the submission of documents. Since I am on parental leave from an organization whose main office is in St. Petersburg, I was able to provide a certificate from the place of work about my payments for 3 months before only 10 days later. On 07/12/21, having the necessary set of documents and their copies in hand, I called the social protection with a request to sign me up for the provision of documents and execution of a social contract. To which I received an answer that they can’t write me down for the reason that the quota for our region for a social contract in the direction I need has been exhausted. There was a social contract only for job search and individual entrepreneur. I understand that there were a lot of applications, the quota ended too quickly. But why is the work of the committee in this direction structured in such a way that they send documents to collect, and do not write them down immediately as they are requested ??? It turns out that I, a mother of two children, on maternity leave, instead of the support I need in the form of a social contract, I get a refusal and several hundred rubles of copying costs (2 copies of each document!). Was it really impossible to immediately register people as they applied for the submission of documents and then analyze the funds remaining under the quota??? And not to encourage, and then refuse! Especially, that the registration for the submission of domains was carried out approximately with a two-week gap from the date of application. This is that everything was done on purpose: first spread information about such a measure of support from everywhere, and then report that there is no money left, are you late???

To which he said `Why should I lose my money?` He returned the card. I said `Well, why do other carriers charge 17 rubles, but you don’t?` After which the driver said `Give me the card again.` I decided that the payment did not go through and because the payment receipt did not come out of the terminal like other carriers and SMS messages on the phone about the debiting of funds have not yet been received, I gave the card. The driver entered the amount of 22 rubles in the terminal. I asked ‘why did you enter such an amount?’ to which he replied ‘There will be another girl to teach me’.

This is the first time we have had this kind of thing in the shelter’s history. The shelter is still surviving only on the funds coming from two contracts, most of which is spent on carrying out activities stipulated by the contracts themselves. contracts, we could spend on the development, improvement of the territory and expansion of the shelter. The debt for treatment at the Leopold veterinary clinic was partially paid off, since new animals were already being treated, it amounts to a little more than 70 thousand rubles.

For example, the cost of a kWh for us costs 9.42 rubles, and a simple resident of the village where the shelter is located pays 2.20 rubles, this is all because we are an NPO, since there is no gas supply. (If we had gas on the territory then payments have decreased many times, but 1,500,000 rubles is the price of supplying gas to the shelter - a cosmic amount for us ....) Garbage removal - 2300 per month. Water - 2000 rubles per month. Nutrition and treatment of animals is carried out at the expense of donations and personal efforts and funds of the founders and volunteers of the shelter. We are also looking for sponsors who can help the shelter on a REGULAR basis, since labor and tax payments must be made monthly. We will any help is welcome, perhaps someone will be able to pay at least one worker, this will already be a significant help.

Therefore, I urge you to accept the traditions.” Further, on 11/24/2020, Yulia Pavlovna received a message “Please, I beg you to donate 400 rubles for the first half of the year to the school fund by December 10.” To my question why and whether this act is voluntary, Yulia Pavlovna replied that this was the director's request. My husband and I did not mind donating the amount of 1000 rubles, like other parents, to the class fund, and we were convinced that the finances were with the members of the parent committee and they were managed by common agreement. However, on 12/03/2020, from correspondence in the general chat of parents, my husband and I learned that the parent committee was not elected at the general parent meeting, but was appointed from among the parents by the class teacher - Yulia Pavlovna, and the class fund money is with her , instead of the parent committee, the class teacher manages the money, giving instructions to the members of the parent committee. Based on this, we had to make a decision to donate money only for what we consider necessary ourselves, without coercion, the husband informed Yulia Pavlovna personally about this decision. In addition, my husband also wrote about our decision regarding the donation of funds in the general chat of the parents, after once again it was proposed to raise money for the repair of the class in the amount of 2000 rubles from each family. On March 18, 2021, my husband, Nikolai Nikolaevich Stepanov, wrote in a general parent chat: “Definitely against these fees. The school is not private, classroom maintenance is the responsibility of the school administration. Dear parents, don't waste your money. I am ready to personally raise this issue with the administration and seek its implementation. When solving minor cosmetic repairs, he is ready to participate in their elimination both physically and financially. Later, the husband turned to the school administration, director Savenkov A.A. At the meeting, the issue of repairing the heating system in the classroom and repairing the classroom itself was raised. The director said that the repair of the heating system will take control and solve it, but he sees no reason for repairing the classroom and believes that this is not necessary. Despite the fact that we had previously informed the class teacher about our position against collecting funds from our parents and specifically from our family, on 07/08/2021 I received a message from the class teacher: “Hello, Elena Gennadievna. I ask you to provide charitable material assistance to the school, namely to our class, for the repair of the office where your son Matvey studies. All parents of children in our class have already done this, and the office is being renovated. Unfortunately, the state does not finance the school in full, parents have to be sponsors of their own free will. On September 1, you came to a clean class, this was done by the parents of the 4th grade, for a year the wallpaper, linoleum, etc. came off and got dirty in the office. Whose children did this, we will not find out, but it is simply necessary for the entire team of parents to clean up, in which everyone except you agreed. I would very much like your family to participate in this and not be separated from the team. Hope you heard me. All the best."" I wrote an answer: “Yulia Pavlovna, hello! We had a conversation with the director, and suggested that we contact the education committee with a request for repairs. The director told us that there were no grounds for repairing our class. Unfortunately, I can’t do charity work now, because our family has enough worries, you know that our family has many children, besides, our grandmother had an operation. I feel pressure in such words as (everyone except you, did not move away from the team, I hope you heard me, etc.) such manipulation is unpleasant to me. Please, I want to make my own decisions about spending my personal budget. How did you know that we are separating from the collective? Is this your personal belief? All the best."" Yulia Pavlovna continued to correspond with “Hello, Elena. Why are you silent? When are you coming for cleaning? Do not write anything in the group, this is how participation in the team is known. In the schools of our city, parents do the cleaning for their children in the summer, because the cleaners are on vacation. Write in the group the answer to my question. Further, the correspondence with Yulia Pavlovna looked like this: [20.07, 10:19] Elena Stepanova: Hello Yulia Pavlovna. I have a feeling of pressure on your part, I feel discomfort from this. I am not in the city during the summer holidays and my vacation. Check the group of parents, my answer is there. [07/20, 10:45] Yulia Pavlovna: What do you suggest? Am I the only one moving cabinets? Wash, clean for all children? I'm also on vacation. [07/20, 10:47] Yulia Pavlovna: Pankova in the group offered to pay the cleaning company. You didn't answer. What do you think? [07/20, 10:50] Yulia Pavlovna: Acceptance of the school on August 1, the office should be clean. All teachers ask parents to help with this. And parents of other classes come together to clean up, but what about us? What pressure? [07/20, 13:55] Elena Stepanova: Yulia Pavlovna, please tell me where it says that each parent is required to answer questions in chats that are not related to the educational process? I feel pressure from you, I'm not comfortable. You can offer anything, this does not mean that we are obliged to agree to respond to all proposals, etc. Why are you writing to me about this? About your assumptions? I ask you not to interfere in our relationship with our parents and not to speculate. Parents are not required to pay for the maintenance and protection of buildings, cleaning companies and equipment for the educational process. The Parents' Committee has the right to decide on the collection of money only in relation to themselves, and not to the parents of all children. Your goal? Why are you asking me all these questions? On 08/06/2021, a message appeared in the general parent chat from a member of the parent committee “Girls, good afternoon. Class renovation completed. All handed over money except for the Stepanovs. There was money left from the repair, we are going to buy birthday gifts for children. Girls, offer what we will buy for our children at the rate of 200-250 rubles per child. I wrote a message to the chat: “Elena, what exactly did you want to say with a public message in the chat, calling our last name ??? I ask you to remove our last name in your message. I feel discrimination, there is a desire to write to the prosecutor's office about pressure and voluntarily forced offers to donate money for the needs of the school, class. I think I have enough resources for this, both emotional and informational. Please do not single out our family from the whole team. Let me remind you that DELIVERY OF MONEY IS A VOLUNTARY DECISION OF A PARENT, ONLY IN RELATION TO YOURSELF AND YOUR CHILD, THE PARENT COMMITTEE DOES NOT DECIDE IT. You know the situation in my family, the reasons, Why did we decide not to hand over the money? If not, you can ask your class teacher. We respect every opinion and decision of the parents in our class, and we ask you to respect our decision. And don't publish our last name publicly in your posts."" After these messages, I was removed from the general chat of parents, where all issues related to our children and the class were discussed, and Yulia Pavlovna also deleted my husband and I from the chat where she sent information related to education. Now we do not have the opportunity to read all the messages regarding the beginning of the school year and the educational process in the second grade, where our son will study. Thanks to such actions of the class teacher, we were made outcasts in the class, depriving us of the opportunity to have the necessary information about the beginning of the school year. We believe that the class teacher created an unhealthy atmosphere in the classroom by putting pressure on parents to raise funds. Communicating with parents, it became clear to us that many of them have the same feelings as we do in relation to the behavior of the class teacher in this matter, but they are afraid to fall out of favor with her so that her attitude does not affect the children. We believe that such a financially unhealthy mood of the class teacher contradicts not only the norms of pedagogical ethics, but also violates the norms provided for by the Constitution of the Russian Federation, the law ""On Education"". Article 43 of the Constitution of the Russian Federation guarantees citizens the right to public access and free general education in state or municipal educational institutions. As stated in the letter of the Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation dated September 9, 2015 N VK-2227/08 ""On the Prevention of Illegal Collections of Funds"", in accordance with Article 5 of the Federal Law of December 29, 2012 N 273-FZ `On education in the Russian Federation` (hereinafter referred to as the Federal Law), the state guarantees to citizens the general availability and free of charge in accordance with the federal state educational standards of preschool, primary general, basic general, secondary general education. According to paragraph 3 of Part 1 of Article 8 of the Federal Law, ensuring state guarantees for the exercise of the rights to receive public and free preschool education in municipal preschool educational organizations, public and free preschool, primary general, basic general, secondary general education in municipal general educational organizations, providing additional education for children in municipal general educational organizations by providing subventions to local budgets, including labor costs, the purchase of textbooks and teaching aids, teaching aids, games, toys (except for the costs of maintaining buildings and paying utility bills). services), in accordance with the standards determined by the state authorities of the constituent entities of the Russian Federation, falls within the competence of the state authorities of the constituent entities of the Russian Federation in the field of education. In this way, the establishment and collection of fees from parents (legal representatives) of students of general educational organizations for educational services and other activities provided within the limits of the relevant federal state educational standard, the financial provision of which is carried out at the expense of the budgetary appropriations of the relevant budget of the Russian Federation, directly contradicts the legislation of the Russian Federation. Parents of students (pupils) are not required to finance activities for the maintenance and protection of buildings of educational institutions, logistics and equipment of the educational process. Any initiative group of citizens, including the parent committee, the board of trustees and other self-government bodies of the educational institution, have the right to make a decision to contribute (collect) funds only in relation to themselves (members of the committee, board of trustees), and not the parents of all children attending this institution. Based on the foregoing, we ask you to: Carry out an appropriate check regarding the facts set forth in the appeal, based on the results of which give us an explanation. Oblige the class teacher of the 2nd class Smirnova Yulia Pavlovna to restore us in parent chats, where information regarding the educational process is reported. Oblige the class teacher of the 2nd class hold a parent meeting of the class to elect a parent committee in accordance with the requirements of the law."

Lgov and transfer to train 141 Kursk-Lgov-Moscow. If you do not change the schedule of commuter train 6443, then you will lose at least 20 passengers who board Blokhin and OP 408 KM, but you will lose more because this commuter train takes all passengers who change to 141 trains. I ask you to reduce the travel time of the commuter train 6443 to a minimum and try to make the travel time 1 hour 45-50 minutes.

But the problem is that one playlist of 10 songs has been playing there for SEVERAL YEARS, without jokes and exaggerations. This is simply impossible, I have already learned all the songs by heart, “You are mine, you are mine”, “Tomorrow at 7:22”, “You and me” and a few more that are not only repeated several times during the day, this goes on it's been more than a year! It became beautiful on the theater square after the renovation, but it’s impossible to be there due to the fact that 10 songs have not been changed for several years, it’s not like sitting on a bench and relaxing, it’s already sickening to pass by these songs. Surely they wanted to do the best by adding music to the square, but it seems to me that it’s better without it at all than listening to the same tasteless playlist for several years. Honestly, soon your ears will wither to listen to the same thing every day. I’m already silent about the fact that this music is heard from neighboring houses on Katya Zelenko Street, there, in general, the residents are already ready to climb the wall. If the square was quiet and there was the sound of fountains it would be much better in my opinion. But if removing this music altogether is not an option, PLEASE change the playlist there, turn on some nice unobtrusive radio like ""On the Seven Hills"" so you can relax and unwind there.

There is a recording of the conversation) for advice on the timing of registration (in my case, extension) of benefits for the first child under 3 years old. In the terms announced by the MFC consultant (in February, since my child turned 1 year old on March 08, 2021), I provided all the necessary documents to extend the allowance. Subsequently, I received a call from an employee from the Social Protection Committee, during which I was informed that I had violated the deadlines for submitting documents and that I was denied benefits. In the future, I re-applied to the MFC with the next set of documents to extend the allowance. And similarly, on a call from an employee of the social protection committee, I receive an oral denial of benefits due to excess income at the time of the application. When I applied in February, my family's income allowed me to qualify for this benefit. I believe that the terms were deliberately shifted to me in violation of the law. Since no refusal was given to me in writing. No reference was provided to the regulatory document, according to which there were grounds for refusal. Thus, the rights of my family in receiving benefits for the first child under 3 years old are violated. I ask you to understand the current situation, give written explanations about the deadlines for submitting documents for processing benefits, the calculation procedure (with an explanation of income taken into account for calculating) in accordance with the law with reference to regulatory documents.

Unfortunately, passengers tear the tint and there is no escape from this kid, it is very difficult for the carrier to keep track of each passenger. I hope that the carrier will understand me correctly and tint the cars, after all, in these minibuses people have to travel 2 hours from Kursk to Lgov. This is not a complaint against the carrier, this is a suggestion on how to improve the quality of transportation.

By December 23-24, the temperature had already risen to 40.5, the saturation dropped to less than 80, it was difficult to breathe without oxygen. After consulting with specialists, they explained to us that with such an already severe course of the disease, Sergey Aleksandrovich Sinyakin needed resuscitation (as we were explained, the Hospital does not have the necessary infrastructure: neither resuscitation, nor CT diagnostics, etc.). The medical staff of the Hospital did not attempt to transfer to the intensive care unit. All our appeals to the attending doctor, to the management of the Hospital about the transfer of Sergey Alexandrovich Sinyakin to the hospital with resuscitation were ignored.

On January 1, 2021, Sergey Alexandrovich Sinyakin passed away. The BSMP resuscitators made it clear that at least 3-4 days earlier, everything might have been different. Why the medical staff of the Hospital kept the patient in a serious condition for so long, no one understood. In total, Sinyakin Sergey Alexandrovich was in the ""Hospital for War Veterans"" for 13 days. Why, during their treatment, no attempts were made to make a CT scan to monitor the condition of the lungs of a patient with a severe form of the disease and the presence of appropriate symptoms. On this portal, our family, YET, wants to get answers to the following questions: why the medical staff of the Hospital, in the first place treating the doctor didn't give Sergey Alexandrovich Sinyakin a chance to fight for his life? Do these people have to decide whether he deserves to receive full medical care or not? We earnestly request: do not ignore this case, understand as much as possible how and how correctly Sergey Alexandrovich Sinyakin was treated, and most importantly, guided by what standards of treatment, the leading doctor decided to leave the patient with such complications without timely transfer to the intensive care unit of any covid the center of Kursk."
