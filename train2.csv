"Hello. It was necessary to write this letter. We write anonymously, because We worry about the fate of the children. There is simply no strength to endure and worry about our children who study at the MBOU school No. 2 in Kursk, in the 4th “b” grade. Class teacher Bezhan Tatyana Konstantinovna. To call her a teacher, and even more so a teacher-psychologist, does not turn the tongue. We do not know how such an “employee” was allowed to enter primary school. At the end of the 4th grade, children will leave with a crippled psyche. And these are not empty words. Children constantly have to be persuaded to go to school, spend hours on it and calm them down. The associations of children with the school are the constant cries of the teacher. How is that possible? Bezhan T.K. regularly insults children, calls them “fools”, “morons”, “children of drunks” (all verbatim) and the list goes on. All parents will attest to this. He constantly yells at children, saying that they are not capable of anything and that they belong in a school for the mentally retarded. And we all know what kind of school it is. Does the primary school teacher really not understand that the child's psyche suffers? The question, of course, is rhetorical… Bezhan T.K. regularly disrupts classes, although the children have congenital malformations, for which there is absolutely no preparation! Several times a week, she cancels math, Russian, and other important classes. Instead, she conducts “explanatory”, as she believes, conversations with the children. With screams. Speaking with girls - about ""prostitutes"", and with boys - about ""convicts"". This is literally one of the examples. Discuss prostitution in 4th grade! What's going on in this teacher's head? Which believes that it is more important to discuss prostitution and the criminal world than to prepare children for CD. Once again, we want to focus on this - there is absolutely no preparation of children for CM. During the distance learning period, the classes were held as follows - in the morning the teacher sent a photo of a leaflet with what needed to be done, and in the evening the parents sent photos of the children's work. That's all. Is this what we were striving for? Is this our worthy education? Yesterday Bezhan T.K. went even further. She made the children stand 2 lessons. Remember, this is 4th grade. The children stood for two lessons and listened to educational conversations and cries ... instead of knowledge. And far from all the facts are described in this open letter. We ask you to deal with this situation, take this teacher under control, and better the whole school, because continue learning in it there is no desire. These words can be confirmed anonymously by all parents. Anonymous, because many are worried about the possible “bullying” of children.",7,False

"Hello, we all write and talk about only one thing: roads, hospitals, bad government, and so on. I have been following the communities of Kursk for a couple of years, but I have never seen anyone write and complain about mobile operators. In the cities of the Kursk region, there is practically no issue in servicing cellular communications, but the quality of service could still be improved in the 21st century. The problem appears at the exits from the city, namely on the highways of the region. Many friends are faced with such a problem: it is possible to get through only to number 112 and that's it. WHY IS THIS HAPPENING? We will not talk about any specific sections of roads, there is such a problem everywhere. Take, for example, roads such as: Kursk - Zheleznogorsk, Kursk - Oboyan, Kursk - Shchigry, Kursk - Lgov - Rylsk, Kursk - Sudzha, leaving Kursk in any direction, we are facing the communication problem of any operator `NO NETWORK`. Verified by personal experience. When we go, for example, in the direction of Moscow - St. Petersburg, the network is everywhere and always. The Kursk region is still making roads, repairing hospitals, etc. While someone is now standing on the road with a broken tire and cannot get through, or even worse, someone has become ill at the wheel and also cannot get through to their relatives and loved ones.

"Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin spoke more than once about the revival of villages. In the Zheleznogorsk district of the Kursk region, a merger of village councils took place. On the territory of the united Linetsky village council there are many villages, villages, farms, which are widely scattered within a radius of 7-15 km. Therefore, during the years of Soviet power, several schools were built on the territory of the united village councils. Years passed, young people from the village left for the city. There are few children left, and only 3 schools remain (Radubezhskaya secondary school, Linetskaya secondary school, Nizhnezhdanovskaya secondary school). The villages of the former Nizhnezhdanovsky s / s are the most remote from the regional center. The former leadership of the Fatezhsky district, which owned the Nizhnezhdanovsky and Linetsky s / s, set the task of reviving the villages. For this purpose, a village was built, gas was supplied, in 2007 (now s / s belonged to the Zheleznogorsk district) a new school was built. Everything in it meets modern requirements. There is a computer class, a workshop, a gym, a dining room are equipped. With the help of children and teachers at the school, a museum of military and labor glory of our fellow villagers was opened, a gallery of the Immortal Regiment was created. Children help take care of the monument to the fallen fellow villagers and know for sure that no one is forgotten and nothing is forgotten. Some graduates remained to serve in the Army on a contract basis, and are currently participating in a military special operation in the Donbass. And everything seemed to work out, young families with children settled in the village. But two schools of the Linetsky s / s were closed (Radubezhskaya secondary school and Linetskaya secondary school). A bus was allocated and children from these schools were taken to the new Nizhnezhdanovsk secondary school. In the 2022-2023 academic year, 51 children of the Linetsky s / s, out of 8 first-graders, should study here. And suddenly the Head of the Administration of the Zheleznogorsk region, Frolkov A.D. makes a decision on the reorganization of the school, referring to the instruction of the Education Committee of the Kursk region, where, allegedly, a decision was made to liquidate 5 schools of the Zheleznogorsk district. They want to expel the children, but where is the new building? Sell? Young families with children are outraged, many of them came to the village of Verkhnee Zhdanovo only because there is a school here. How is it possible to close all the schools of the united village councils and the theme is to cross out everything that has been done under the program for the revival of the village. Is our country really so poor that it cannot afford the maintenance of even one school in the territory of the united village councils. So the revival of the villages for the Linetsky s / s has ended, no school means no future. And in the village of Verkhnee Zhdanovo, the House of Culture, a kindergarten, and a post office have already been closed. Probably, the management wants to close the school in order to finally destroy the village. We, the residents of the Linetsky village council, appeal to you with a request: do not let our villages be destroyed, help defend our school.",7,False

Our family consists of 4 people, in which 2 twin children, born in 2018, are forced to live on the same salary of a spouse who works in the Federal Penitentiary Service of Russia in the Kursk Region (we fit the category of beneficiaries), my husband has to go to work and a second job it is forbidden. I can't go to work there is no one to leave the children with, my mother is a disabled person of the 2nd group at heart, we don’t have more close relatives in Kursk, we can’t hire a nanny or send the children to a private kindergarten for financial reasons, about 60% of my husband’s salary goes to pay off mortgage lending and utility bills., it is very difficult for a family with 2 small children to live on the remaining amount. In this regard, I ask you to consider the candidacies of my children Matyukhova Polina Pavlovna born on 21.09.2018. and Matyukhov Konstantin Pavlovich born on September 21, 2018 for enrollment in kindergarten No. 11. located at the address: Kursk, A.

"Hello. I am writing about a doctor from the perinatal center - Sapranova N.A. Iz-for it almost there was a miscarriage and a nervous breakdown! And I am silent about the rather large amount of money that I spent to double-check her conclusion on the ultrasound. I was given a referral at the LCD for the first screening in the opts to N.A. Sapranova on April 11, 2022. After this screening, my life was divided into before and after. The fact is that a year ago I was diagnosed with an endometrioid cyst, I treated it, and not a single doctor confirmed this diagnosis to me. Before the screening, the last ultrasound was on March 14 in the LCD. Everything was fine, I was confirmed pregnant and, of course, this cyst. At the screening, I told the doctor this information, to which, she answered me that it was necessary to remove the cyst, and in general I became pregnant only because I really want to get married. I just kept silent on this statement, although my personal life does not concern her. But these are all trifles compared to what happened next. When this doctor performed a gynecological ultrasound, she discussed with the nurse, one might even say in a joking way, that the last patient had no vices, like morning they didn’t have a problem, and she began to dictate to the nurse already according to my situation, and then again smile , and such an expression from the doctor “it would be better if there were only myomas today”, in the end I don’t understand anything, she doesn’t tell me anything and confidently asserted that my entire small pelvis is in metastases, then she called another doctor who is with her fully agreed. I started to panic, I ask what it threatens, to which I heard in a very rude form “you will talk with the oncologist, he will tell you what it threatens”, she also continued to joke with the nurse. Then she sent me to a gynecologist, and while I was sitting in line with a gynecologist, I had to read on the Internet what kind of diagnosis it was, I was shocked. And that's putting it mildly. There is cancer, namely peritoneal carcinomatosis, this is one of the most terrible types of cancer, if not the most terrible. The gynecologist gave a referral to the cancer center. They didn’t take me there right away, but they signed me up only for April 19, naturally, I wouldn’t have lived up to that time morally, I signed up for a paid ultrasound of the abdominal cavity, for re-screening. And the doctors to whom I showed the diagnosis from Sapranova were dumbfounded how it was possible to write such a thing on one study. When I underwent a second screening, the doctor told me that she had not only diagnosed me, but pronounced a sentence. That's where I got my tests done. But just to make sure that everything is fine with me, Just in case, I went to another clinic and did another screening. There, the doctor, of course, was also shocked by what he saw. And the most interesting thing is that not a single doctor saw metastases, although she claimed that I had absolutely everything in metastases. Then I went to the oncology center, to the oncogynecologist, it so happened that they accepted me earlier. This doctor was also in shock, like the previous 4. She said that it was a rather high-profile diagnosis, she made me, looked at all my screenings and gave a referral for ultrasound to the oncology center, where I had an ultrasound and another doctor was shocked by Sapranova's diagnosis. I was confirmed with an endometriosis cyst, all the doctors, except for Sapranova, everyone asked me the question, where are the metastases ???? But now I would very much like to personally ask this doctor of the highest category. It's hard for me to call her a doctor after that, I find it hard to even call her human. What I experienced, I would not wish this on anyone. I am really very interested in how a doctor of the highest category cannot distinguish a cyst from cancer, and also why out of many doctors in Kursk, only she sees metastases? Does she have some special vision?",4,False
