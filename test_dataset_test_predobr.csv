To which I received an answer that they can’t write me down for the reason that the quota for our region for a social contract in the direction I need has been exhausted. There was a social contract only for job search and individual entrepreneur. I understand that there were a lot of applications, the quota ended too quickly. But why is the work of the committee in this direction structured in such a way that they send documents to collect, and do not write them down immediately as they are requested ??? It turns out that I, a mother of two children, on maternity leave, instead of the support I need in the form of a social contract, I get a refusal and several hundred rubles of copying costs (2 copies of each document!). Was it really impossible to immediately register people as they applied for the submission of documents and then analyze the funds remaining under the quota??? And not to encourage, and then refuse! Especially, that the registration for the submission of domains was carried out approximately with a two-week gap from the date of application. This is that everything was done on purpose: first spread information about such a measure of support from everywhere, and then report that there is no money left, are you late??? Apparently, everyone is equal, but someone is more equal!"

The driver entered the amount of 22 rubles in the terminal. I asked ‘why did you enter such an amount?’ to which he replied ‘There will be another girl to teach me’.

The windows of our apartment overlook the concrete fence of Rostelecom. Grass under the windows - the sea. The burdock has grown to such an extent that it can be touched by reaching out to it. The problem of trees is a separate issue. Sunlight hardly gets into the apartment, and dry trees completely interfere with the neighbors above. In my memory, since the purchase of the apartment (which is about 7 years), this area has not been cleaned. We cleaned on our own: we climbed out of the window, took a chainsaw, a lawn mower, cleaned the American maple tree with all available means, behind which absolutely NOTHING was visible. In my opinion, such a “work” of the Criminal Code is not normal. This complaint has been repeatedly covered in the Criminal Code. As you can see, the result is zero.

I have been suffering from type 1 diabetes since November 2016. I am attached to the polyclinic No. 7, Kursk, Zavodskaya st., 25. My rights to provide medicines are regularly violated. So on 01/14/2021, the endocrinologist wrote out a prescription for Akkuchek-Active test strips in the amount of 100 pcs (2 packs). This prescription is currently not stocked in the pharmacy. A prescription for test strips was placed for deferred maintenance on 02/04/2021. As of 04/05/2021, test strips have not been received. According to the Order of the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation “On Approval of Standards of Medical Care for Adults with Type 1 Diabetes” dated 01/13/2021 No. 1053n patients with type 1 diabetes are entitled to 2190 test strips per year (6 measurements per day) or 7 packs for 2 months!!! For three months in 2021, I received only insulin, the doctor does not prescribe needles at all, test strips I was discharged once, but they are still not available in the pharmacy. Twice a week I call the pharmacy on my own or come, but the pharmacy answers that there are no strips according to my prescription. Very little has been purchased and is given to those who were previously on the waiting list. I consider this fact a gross violation of the law. My life is constantly put in danger, because I have to give insulin injections to my eye, not knowing what my blood sugar level is. I do not officially work, I take care of a disabled child who is not yet three years old. I don't have a disability. There is no own money to buy test strips."

Further, route No. 55 turns left at the intersection, for which the bus must take the leftmost lane in accordance with the traffic rules of the Russian Federation. Starting from the middle of the driving pocket of the above stop, the leftmost lane is separated from the adjacent passing lane by a solid marking line 1.1, which is prohibited to cross according to the traffic rules of the Russian Federation. In this regard, it is proposed to install sign 5.15.1 'Direction of lanes' before the intersection of Zopolnaya and 50 Let Oktyabrya from the side of Zapolnaya Street, allowing a left turn from Zapolnaya Street to 50 Let Oktyabrya Street from the middle lane and eliminating the need to rebuild buses to the extreme left strip."
1816,"Due to the decrease in fees, the lack of any funding for the shelter from the city or regional authorities, since June we have been forced to reduce the number of shifts of workers, since this month we encountered difficulty in paying salaries. This is the first time we have had this kind of thing in the shelter’s history. The shelter is still surviving only on the funds coming from two contracts, most of which is spent on carrying out activities stipulated by the contracts themselves. contracts, we could spend on the development, improvement of the territory and expansion of the shelter. The debt for treatment at the Leopold veterinary clinic was partially paid off, since new animals were already being treated, it amounts to a little more than 70 thousand rubles. The salary fund per month with tax and insurance payments is about 230,000-280,000 rubles, depending on the number of shifts, the employment of workers in the treatment of animals and their transportation. This is practically at minimum wages. In addition, given the remoteness of the shelter, we are forced to reimburse the expenses for travel and gasoline to employees, since these are significant expenses for people. Payments for electricity in the winter period from November to March are 50,000-55,000 rubles per month, in the summer period 15,000-18,000 rubles per month. month. For example, the cost of a kWh for us costs 9.42 rubles, and a simple resident of the village where the shelter is located pays 2.20 rubles, this is all because we are an NPO, since there is no gas supply. (If we had gas on the territory then payments have decreased many times, but 1,500,000 rubles is the price of supplying gas to the shelter - a cosmic amount for us ....) Garbage removal - 2300 per month. Water - 2000 rubles per month. Nutrition and treatment of animals is carried out at the expense of donations and personal efforts and funds of the founders and volunteers of the shelter. We are also looking for sponsors who can help the shelter on a REGULAR basis, since labor and tax payments must be made monthly. We will any help is welcome, perhaps someone will be able to pay at least one worker, this will already be a significant help. There are a lot of animals now, a quality annex is not always fast. work and help animals, as well as reduce their number on the streets of the city and the region. Roman, Kursk region https://vk."

The road has never been cleaned on this section, although the neighboring streets: Oboyanskaya and Krasnopolyanskaya are cleaned almost daily. There is already such a track that cars sit on their belly. How long will this chaos last? Why do workers bypass this section of the road and the adjacent sidewalk!?

2121,"In the area of ​​the shopping center `Europe-40`, located at the address: Kursk, Studencheskaya street, 1, there is a site used for parking vehicles of visitors to the shopping center. This area is crossed by tram tracks. Pedestrian railings are installed along the tram tracks, except for places where vehicles or pedestrians can move across the tram tracks. Due to the lack of a sidewalk, pedestrian traffic from residential buildings in the North-Western microdistrict towards 50 Let Oktyabrya and Zalnaya streets is carried out only through the indicated area. The crossing of tram tracks is carried out in places where there are no railings, including at the pedestrian crossing marked with marking 1.14.1. Recently, in the morning hours, when the movement of pedestrians through this area in the direction of the public transport stop `Zapolnaya Street`, to the place of work or to the City Polyclinic No. 5 is quite intense, the sections where the pedestrian paths intersect with the tram tracks are blocked by cables and other portable metal fences. These fences are supposedly installed by employees of the Europe-40 shopping center, which interferes with the movement of pedestrians, and there is a threat of injury to pedestrians. If a healthy person, noticing this fence in time, can bypass it, and step over the cable, then elderly or visually impaired people, who, due to the location of the City Polyclinic No. Besides, these fences completely exclude the possibility of movement from Studencheskaya Street in the direction of 50 Let Oktyabrya and Zalnaya Streets for people with limited mobility and pedestrians driving prams.

Pursuant to article 267 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation, deliberate obstruction of traffic and pedestrians on the road network, if these acts have endangered the life, health and safety of citizens or the threat of destruction or damage to the property of individuals and (or) legal entities, is punishable by a fine in the amount of one hundred thousand to three hundred thousand rubles, as well as imprisonment.

As far as I know, MSW refers to those types of utilities, the amount of payment for which is calculated based on consumption standards, and paying for something that I did not use is clearly contrary to the Consumer Rights Protection Law. At the same time, Art. 11 hours 155 of the LCD allows recalculation in the temporary absence of citizens in the premises. Thus, the complete absence of residents living in the apartment is a special case of the temporary absence of the consumer, which certainly entails the recalculation of fees for the treatment of MSW.

322,"Good afternoon! Near the school number 54 on weekdays it is simply impossible to pass because of the cars at the time when the school starts and ends the lessons. And most do not stop at dropping off passengers in the yard and leaving, but go straight to the school on a road that is no longer a carriageway. A huge number of people walking along this road are forced to keep clear, cars almost run into the heels of first-graders, if a child rides a scooter, they will simply knock him down. At the same time, cars drive not only from the side of the yard, but also right along the alley leading from the public transport stop and along the road passing between the school and kindergarten No. 120. As a result, the road surface deteriorates. The car is parked right on the lawn, on which there is simply no grass left because of this and all the curbs are lopsided. During periods of rain, the entire alley and the entrance to the school are covered with mud, it is simply impossible for pedestrians to walk. Cars are also parked directly under the fence of the kindergarten site. At the same time, those who park, who turn on loud music, who throw bulls from the car window into the garden. Not only those who take their children to school, garden and just go to work through this place suffer from this, but also the residents of the houses standing there, because they are forced to live in this disgusting and go to the store along a dirty sidewalk that looks like a country road after rain . and is unsafe and slippery, especially for the elderly. And children riding scooters and bicycles are constantly in danger because of passing cars. The problem is not new, it has already been repeatedly addressed to the authorities. The stumbling block is that in the event of a complete closure of travel on these roads to the kindergarten and school, official vehicles or ambulances, if necessary, will not be able to pass. After all, you can not block the passage completely, but leave the possibility of entry for official cars, for example, by installing a barrier or in another way. Entrances not intended for transport can be blocked completely, especially where the alley passes. So that cars do not park on lawns, trees and bushes can be planted, which will also help to ennoble the territory. The measures taken earlier are absolutely ineffective, raids carried out by the traffic police do not give results and there are no fewer cars. In this regard, I ask you to take a responsible approach to solving the problem with the passage of cars to this territory, to make effective decisions on the organization of passage, and not just “put a tick” on resolving this issue."

1069,"Our son, Stepanov Matvey Nikolaevich, is a second-grade student of the secondary school with in-depth study of individual subjects No. 56 in the city of Kursk, whose class teacher is Yulia Pavlovna Smirnova. Throughout the first year of our son's first grade, we felt pressure from the class teacher due to persistent requests to donate money to the school fund for certain needs. Such requests were stated by the class teacher, both in the general chat of parents and in individual messages. In support of our arguments, I state the facts reflected in the correspondence with the class teacher, and attach a screenshot of the messages. So, on August 17, 2020, I received a personal message from Yulia Pavlovna with the following content: “In Kursk, parents provide financial assistance to the school on a voluntary basis , but there is also a team of parents who should be friendly. Therefore, I urge you to accept the traditions.” Further, on 11/24/2020, Yulia Pavlovna received a message “Please, I beg you to donate 400 rubles for the first half of the year to the school fund by December 10.” To my question why and whether this act is voluntary, Yulia Pavlovna replied that this was the director's request. My husband and I did not mind donating the amount of 1000 rubles, like other parents, to the class fund, and we were convinced that the finances were with the members of the parent committee and they were managed by common agreement. However, on 12/03/2020, from correspondence in the general chat of parents, my husband and I learned that the parent committee was not elected at the general parent meeting, but was appointed from among the parents by the class teacher - Yulia Pavlovna, and the class fund money is with her , instead of the parent committee, the class teacher manages the money, giving instructions to the members of the parent committee. Based on this, we had to make a decision to donate money only for what we consider necessary ourselves, without coercion, the husband informed Yulia Pavlovna personally about this decision. In addition, my husband also wrote about our decision regarding the donation of funds in the general chat of the parents, after once again it was proposed to raise money for the repair of the class in the amount of 2000 rubles from each family. On March 18, 2021, my husband, Nikolai Nikolaevich Stepanov, wrote in a general parent chat: “Definitely against these fees. The school is not private, classroom maintenance is the responsibility of the school administration. Dear parents, don't waste your money. I am ready to personally raise this issue with the administration and seek its implementation. When solving minor cosmetic repairs, he is ready to participate in their elimination both physically and financially. Later, the husband turned to the school administration, director Savenkov A.A. At the meeting, the issue of repairing the heating system in the classroom and repairing the classroom itself was raised. The director said that the repair of the heating system will take control and solve it, but he sees no reason for repairing the classroom and believes that this is not necessary. Despite the fact that we had previously informed the class teacher about our position against collecting funds from our parents and specifically from our family, on 07/08/2021 I received a message from the class teacher: “Hello, Elena Gennadievna. I ask you to provide charitable material assistance to the school, namely to our class, for the repair of the office where your son Matvey studies. All parents of children in our class have already done this, and the office is being renovated. Unfortunately, the state does not finance the school in full, parents have to be sponsors of their own free will. On September 1, you came to a clean class, this was done by the parents of the 4th grade, for a year the wallpaper, linoleum, etc. came off and got dirty in the office. Whose children did this, we will not find out, but it is simply necessary for the entire team of parents to clean up, in which everyone except you agreed. I would very much like your family to participate in this and not be separated from the team. Hope you heard me. All the best."" I wrote an answer: “Yulia Pavlovna, hello! We had a conversation with the director, and suggested that we contact the education committee with a request for repairs. The director told us that there were no grounds for repairing our class. Unfortunately, I can’t do charity work now, because our family has enough worries, you know that our family has many children, besides, our grandmother had an operation. I feel pressure in such words as (everyone except you, did not move away from the team, I hope you heard me, etc.) such manipulation is unpleasant to me. Please, I want to make my own decisions about spending my personal budget. How did you know that we are separating from the collective? Is this your personal belief? All the best."" Yulia Pavlovna continued to correspond with “Hello, Elena. Why are you silent? When are you coming for cleaning? Do not write anything in the group, this is how participation in the team is known. In the schools of our city, parents do the cleaning for their children in the summer, because the cleaners are on vacation. Write in the group the answer to my question. Further, the correspondence with Yulia Pavlovna looked like this: [20.07, 10:19] Elena Stepanova: Hello Yulia Pavlovna. I have a feeling of pressure on your part, I feel discomfort from this. I am not in the city during the summer holidays and my vacation. Check the group of parents, my answer is there. [07/20, 10:45] Yulia Pavlovna: What do you suggest? Am I the only one moving cabinets? Wash, clean for all children? I'm also on vacation. [07/20, 10:47] Yulia Pavlovna: Pankova in the group offered to pay the cleaning company. You didn't answer. What do you think? [07/20, 10:50] Yulia Pavlovna: Acceptance of the school on August 1, the office should be clean. All teachers ask parents to help with this. And parents of other classes come together to clean up, but what about us? What pressure? [07/20, 13:55] Elena Stepanova: Yulia Pavlovna, please tell me where it says that each parent is required to answer questions in chats that are not related to the educational process? I feel pressure from you, I'm not comfortable. You can offer anything, this does not mean that we are obliged to agree to respond to all proposals, etc. Why are you writing to me about this? About your assumptions? I ask you not to interfere in our relationship with our parents and not to speculate. Parents are not required to pay for the maintenance and protection of buildings, cleaning companies and equipment for the educational process. The Parents' Committee has the right to decide on the collection of money only in relation to themselves, and not to the parents of all children. Your goal? Why are you asking me all these questions? On 08/06/2021, a message appeared in the general parent chat from a member of the parent committee “Girls, good afternoon. Class renovation completed. All handed over money except for the Stepanovs. There was money left from the repair, we are going to buy birthday gifts for children. Girls, offer what we will buy for our children at the rate of 200-250 rubles per child. I wrote a message to the chat: “Elena, what exactly did you want to say with a public message in the chat, calling our last name ??? I ask you to remove our last name in your message. I feel discrimination, there is a desire to write to the prosecutor's office about pressure and voluntarily forced offers to donate money for the needs of the school, class. I think I have enough resources for this, both emotional and informational. Please do not single out our family from the whole team. Let me remind you that DELIVERY OF MONEY IS A VOLUNTARY DECISION OF A PARENT, ONLY IN RELATION TO YOURSELF AND YOUR CHILD, THE PARENT COMMITTEE DOES NOT DECIDE IT. You know the situation in my family, the reasons, Why did we decide not to hand over the money? If not, you can ask your class teacher. We respect every opinion and decision of the parents in our class, and we ask you to respect our decision. And don't publish our last name publicly in your posts."" After these messages, I was removed from the general chat of parents, where all issues related to our children and the class were discussed, and Yulia Pavlovna also deleted my husband and I from the chat where she sent information related to education. Now we do not have the opportunity to read all the messages regarding the beginning of the school year and the educational process in the second grade, where our son will study. Thanks to such actions of the class teacher, we were made outcasts in the class, depriving us of the opportunity to have the necessary information about the beginning of the school year. We believe that the class teacher created an unhealthy atmosphere in the classroom by putting pressure on parents to raise funds. Communicating with parents, it became clear to us that many of them have the same feelings as we do in relation to the behavior of the class teacher in this matter, but they are afraid to fall out of favor with her so that her attitude does not affect the children. We believe that such a financially unhealthy mood of the class teacher contradicts not only the norms of pedagogical ethics, but also violates the norms provided for by the Constitution of the Russian Federation, the law ""On Education"". Article 43 of the Constitution of the Russian Federation guarantees citizens the right to public access and free general education in state or municipal educational institutions. As stated in the letter of the Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation dated September 9, 2015 N VK-2227/08 ""On the Prevention of Illegal Collections of Funds"", in accordance with Article 5 of the Federal Law of December 29, 2012 N 273-FZ `On education in the Russian Federation` (hereinafter referred to as the Federal Law), the state guarantees to citizens the general availability and free of charge in accordance with the federal state educational standards of preschool, primary general, basic general, secondary general education. According to paragraph 3 of Part 1 of Article 8 of the Federal Law, ensuring state guarantees for the exercise of the rights to receive public and free preschool education in municipal preschool educational organizations, public and free preschool, primary general, basic general, secondary general education in municipal general educational organizations, providing additional education for children in municipal general educational organizations by providing subventions to local budgets, including labor costs, the purchase of textbooks and teaching aids, teaching aids, games, toys (except for the costs of maintaining buildings and paying utility bills). services), in accordance with the standards determined by the state authorities of the constituent entities of the Russian Federation, falls within the competence of the state authorities of the constituent entities of the Russian Federation in the field of education. In this way, the establishment and collection of fees from parents (legal representatives) of students of general educational organizations for educational services and other activities provided within the limits of the relevant federal state educational standard, the financial provision of which is carried out at the expense of the budgetary appropriations of the relevant budget of the Russian Federation, directly contradicts the legislation of the Russian Federation. Parents of students (pupils) are not required to finance activities for the maintenance and protection of buildings of educational institutions, logistics and equipment of the educational process. Any initiative group of citizens, including the parent committee, the board of trustees and other self-government bodies of the educational institution, have the right to make a decision to contribute (collect) funds only in relation to themselves (members of the committee, board of trustees), and not the parents of all children attending this institution. Based on the foregoing, we ask you to: Carry out an appropriate check regarding the facts set forth in the appeal, based on the results of which give us an explanation. Oblige the class teacher of the 2nd class Smirnova Yulia Pavlovna to restore us in parent chats, where information regarding the educational process is reported. Oblige the class teacher of the 2nd class hold a parent meeting of the class to elect a parent committee in accordance with the requirements of the law."

It became beautiful on the theater square after the renovation, but it’s impossible to be there due to the fact that 10 songs have not been changed for several years, it’s not like sitting on a bench and relaxing, it’s already sickening to pass by these songs. Surely they wanted to do the best by adding music to the square, but it seems to me that it’s better without it at all than listening to the same tasteless playlist for several years. Honestly, soon your ears will wither to listen to the same thing every day. I’m already silent about the fact that this music is heard from neighboring houses on Katya Zelenko Street, there, in general, the residents are already ready to climb the wall.

They turned it off for a week, but at the appointed time, namely September 12 (at that time they promised to turn on the water, please note that on September 12 no work was carried out at all, all day), hot water was not given.

Also, due to the proximity of school 20, there are almost always schoolchildren on it, and often, these are high school students who do not always take care of the site. We, adults, try to make comments and call for its careful exploitation, but it is impossible to always monitor this situation. Maybe because of this, the site, having not existed even for a year, has already begun to break down. I really do not want this place to turn into ruins with broken swings, slides, so that it becomes, to some extent, a place dangerous for games. Please, take control of this place, fix the broken structures. I really want to continue to come to the park and have a great time there.

Shkolnaya, 7 and employees of Zhil.servis IP Zholudev P.A., located at the address: Kursk, K.Vorobyova St., 25, in connection with the flooding of my apartment by a plumber of Zhilservis, named Nikolay (I learned the name from neighbors). 02.10.2021 this citizen took the keys to the technical floor and, on his own initiative, decided to open hot water; when he bled air in the pipes, he forgot to close the tap, which led to the flooding of entrances No. 2 and No. 3 with boiling water, from floors 9 to 1-3, after the flooding began, the neighbors met him in the yard and informed him that the apartments had begun to be heated, to which he first spoke obscenely to them, and then replied: “I have a day off today, call an emergency gang ”and hurriedly left (this fact can be confirmed by neighbors), that is, he didn’t have a day off to open the water, but after 15 minutes, when they began to tell him that he was heating apartments, did he suddenly have a day off? On the face of obvious negligence, a gross violation of all norms and recklessness. Also, nowhere, absolutely nowhere was there an announcement warning that the heating would be turned on, and by the way, they did not happen even once. By the time it was Saturday, I didn’t get through to Zhilservis and the Management Company of Kursk, they didn’t pick up the phone. The emergency service also reported that plumbers are on duty in all the UK except for ours, because hot water is turned on throughout the city, but only our plumber is not on duty. as a result, on this day, he categorically did not want to pick up the phone from me, there were beeps, but he did not answer, I called back, sometimes it was busy, which means he spoke to someone, but did not want to talk to me, I called him 8 times this day and for 8 times he turned off the phone, apparently, because he was no longer available and I called on 10/07/21. He blocked me, it was busy all the time. I also called once to Zhilservis and no one picked up the phone in the Criminal Code. I called the chief engineer of the Criminal Code, he only got rude to me, saying: “well, they flooded and flooded”, and when asked to fire the plumber, he said: “find a new one then”, let me know that these are my problems and he doesn’t give a damn at all, it feels like I called king. Subsequently, on 10/12/2021, one chief engineer of Zhilservis IP Zholudev P.A. came, by the name of Mikhail, drew up a dubious act, in which much remained not reflected and not described, explaining that this act simply reflects the fact that I didn’t flood the apartment myself, but only fixes the fact of flooding, a lot was left not made, for example, a wardrobe because Mikhail said that: “they don’t fix the furniture”, not all the swollen laminate, because “the boss, he can say that he was simply poorly bedded from the very beginning”, etc., and in principle this act does not reflect the full scale of the flooding of my apartment, it is written very briefly and dryly, I did not sign this act, I refused to sign it , because I don’t agree with him. I wrote complaints to the Criminal Code and Zhilservice, so that they collect a commission and make an assessment of the damage caused through their fault, I called the Criminal Code a huge number of times, no one came, they didn’t take the phone from me, in rare cases they took it, but they said that the one who deals with my issue is not there. I also wrote to the Housing Inspectorate, they didn't even answer me. I sent all complaints by registered mail and duplicated complaints by mail. As a result, all the same, at the beginning of November (approximately, I don’t remember the date), Mikhail Alexandrovich, the chief engineer of Zhilservis, came to me, Natalya Sergeevna, head of the legal department of the Criminal Code, and as I understand it, a hired estimator of the Criminal Code, apparently they don’t have their own in the state, again examined the apartment and said that the estimate would be in a week and they would contact me, now it’s 11/22/21, no one contacted me, I myself called Natalya Sergeevna, the head of the legal department Criminal Code (8-908-124-88-11), she said that by the evening she would find out everything according to my estimate, without waiting for a return call, I called her myself, she did not pick up the phone and did not call back. And it is also suspicious that at first they sent me a letter saying that they had already prepared their estimate and did not agree with my estimate, and then only they really sewed on to inspect and mark the damage, in general they made a false reply, and then they just came. I sent everything to the Criminal Code (complaints, estimates, details, etc.), I am attaching scans to this application, the amount of the estimate is adequate, their incompetent plumber destroyed half of the apartment for me, and now they are hiding from me and keep silent. Because of their flooding, mold appeared in the apartment, I am a disabled person of the 2nd group, I have a 3-year-old child in the apartment, now because of them we breathe mold, which is dangerous for life and health, I need money to make repairs and destroy the mold until she spread throughout the apartment, she already appeared in two rooms, one of which is for children, make repairs at my own expense, I have no money.

There is a recording of the conversation) for advice on the timing of registration (in my case, extension) of benefits for the first child under 3 years old. In the terms announced by the MFC consultant (in February, since my child turned 1 year old on March 08, 2021), I provided all the necessary documents to extend the allowance. Subsequently, I received a call from an employee from the Social Protection Committee, during which I was informed that I had violated the deadlines for submitting documents and that I was denied benefits. In the future, I re-applied to the MFC with the next set of documents to extend the allowance. And similarly, on a call from an employee of the social protection committee, I receive an oral denial of benefits due to excess income at the time of the application. When I applied in February, my family's income allowed me to qualify for this benefit. I believe that the terms were deliberately shifted to me in violation of the law. Since no refusal was given to me in writing. No reference was provided to the regulatory document, according to which there were grounds for refusal. Thus, the rights of my family in receiving benefits for the first child under 3 years old are violated. I ask you to understand the current situation, give written explanations about the deadlines for submitting documents for processing benefits, the calculation procedure (with an explanation of income taken into account for calculating) in accordance with the law with reference to regulatory documents.

After 2 weeks on 06/27/2021, hot water was turned on according to the plan. After this switch-on, in our houses, a well was flooded next to the heating unit (the residents saw that steam was coming from there), they called the emergency service, they turned off the water and left. According to the assumptions of the residents who have lived here all their lives, this was due to the fact that at one time pipes were changed in this well, and the old pipe was simply cut off without putting a plug. And they gave water through two branches (both through a new pipe and an old one, apparently they have such “specialists” who don’t even have time to look at the documents on which branch water should be connected to these houses). Since then, we have no hot water in two houses. Nobody wants to deal with this. We have repeatedly appealed to various services of the city, namely: to “Quadra”, “Our City” Criminal Code, Housing Inspectorate, 112. But no one anywhere gives us an answer to the question: when will hot water finally be available. Everywhere they simply answer that there was an accident and repairs are underway (although we think that this is not so, they simply cannot understand what happened). We are sure that this is an excuse, no one understands anything, and the people living in these houses are suffering. We cannot control or at least see where this repair is really going on (and is it really so, because there are no repairs going on along the street), so we are forced to turn to you for help. Please help us sort out this issue (tell them about the two pipes in the well - they can't hear us) and also help us speed up the elimination of this problem. We need hot water! PS :"

After 3-4 days, his condition began to worsen: shortness of breath, cough, constantly high temperature appeared, saturation decreased. By December 23-24, the temperature had already risen to 40.5, the saturation dropped to less than 80, it was difficult to breathe without oxygen. After consulting with specialists, they explained to us that with such an already severe course of the disease, Sergey Aleksandrovich Sinyakin needed resuscitation (as we were explained, the Hospital does not have the necessary infrastructure: neither resuscitation, nor CT diagnostics, etc.). The medical staff of the Hospital did not attempt to transfer to the intensive care unit. All our appeals to the attending doctor, to the management of the Hospital about the transfer of Sergey Alexandrovich Sinyakin to the hospital with resuscitation were ignored. Only on December 28, late in the evening, Sergey Alexandrovich Sinyakin was transferred to the intensive care unit of the emergency hospital, already in an EXTREMELY serious condition, with damage to the lungs of CT-4. On January 1, 2021, Sergey Alexandrovich Sinyakin passed away. The BSMP resuscitators made it clear that at least 3-4 days earlier, everything might have been different. Why the medical staff of the Hospital kept the patient in a serious condition for so long, no one understood. In total, Sinyakin Sergey Alexandrovich was in the ""Hospital for War Veterans"" for 13 days. Why, during their treatment, no attempts were made to make a CT scan to monitor the condition of the lungs of a patient with a severe form of the disease and the presence of appropriate symptoms. On this portal, our family, YET, wants to get answers to the following questions: why the medical staff of the Hospital, in the first place treating the doctor didn't give Sergey Alexandrovich Sinyakin a chance to fight for his life? Do these people have to decide whether he deserves to receive full medical care or not? We earnestly request: do not ignore this case, understand as much as possible how and how correctly Sergey Alexandrovich Sinyakin was treated, and most importantly, guided by what standards of treatment, the leading doctor decided to leave the patient with such complications without timely transfer to the intensive care unit of any covid the center of Kursk."

963,"In the village of Zolotukhino, in its very center, for a long time, sewage flows in a continuous stream into the Polevaya Again River. In the area of ​​​​Ordzhonikidze, Novaya and Frunze streets, there are sewer wells of nearby apartment buildings. Streams of sewage from overflowing sewer wells reach the river after 300-400 meters. Special grooves were dug for them. Probably, these are the measures that were taken by the responsible persons, as the local residents claim that they repeatedly reported this problem to the local administration. Wells are periodically pumped out, as evidenced by uncovered hatches and traces of trucks, but pumping contributes only to a small decrease in the continuously flowing flow. Runoff is especially abundant on weekends when sewer wells are not pumped out at all. I think this problem has gone far beyond the problems of local residents, since there is a district clinic nearby, where a sharp unpleasant smell is carried by the wind, a stream with sewage often serves as a serious obstacle for pedestrians, and the river Polevaya Again, already polluted, carries its waters to Tuskar . During the summer period, the entire territory is abundantly overgrown, partially hiding open wells. A man fell into one of these open wells last Sunday and was seriously injured, which forced me to turn to you. An appeal to the Committee of Natural Resources of the Kursk region did not bring any results. Response from this department dated July 13: “The information is being checked by the committee staff. We will inform you about the results later.” It's been 2 months. Everything.
