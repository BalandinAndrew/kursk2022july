"A caustic and unhealthy smell from the quarries of the Cheese Valley plant. - they clean pipes and technical baths with `caustic soda`, then this liquid is poured into the soil without filtration, from where everything enters the groundwater; - in recent years there have been two big fires in the quarries. fat is drained there, which burns well. The gas pipeline was damaged due to the fire. In the presence of wind, the village could burn down; - a pungent odor spreads up to 10 km in different directions, depending on the direction of the wind; - sewage fell into the forest in winter, and a couple of years ago into the pond of Kalinovka village; - an activist who fought against this phenomenon (Dmitry Kutepov) was intimidated by the plant's guards, and people from law enforcement agencies were threatened with a prison term; - Since 2008, the villagers have been complaining, but no action has been taken; - Children have repeatedly fallen into these careers, incl. Adults. No deaths; - headaches and asthma attacks develop from a pungent odor. * Clean water is purposefully collected in one quarry. This quarry is located near the road and all inspections take samples from it. Made it specifically for this. At the moment, waste is drained at night, but it happens during the day. Always at different times. When draining, the fatty film on the surface is broken and everything is tightened with a pungent odor. According to the norms and legislation of the Russian Federation, this production should not be located near residential buildings. Hence, there is a gross violation of the location of production and the location of its tanks for draining sewage. We hope that the laws of the Russian Federation will be observed and production will be moved to another place far from residential buildings or the pits will be drained,",16,False
"Good afternoon. At the stop `Ploshchad Rokossovskogo` the underpass is in very poor condition. It is difficult to go down into it and it is difficult to climb out of it, since its steps are broken, and in winter ice still appears on them, which makes movement several times more difficult (both going down to this underground passage and going up). There is a great opportunity to fall and get injured, even holding on to the railing, because if the steps are just icy, then there is still an opportunity to somehow hold on to them, leaning on the railing when descending or ascending, and in this case, the steps of this transition are not only covered with ice in winter , but they are also in a terrible state that is dangerous to people's health. I ask you to deal with this problem and make good steps in this underground passage. Sincerely, Polovinkin V. S.",0,False

"Good afternoon. Today, 08/17/2021, an accident involving a pedestrian occurred in front of my house. Not so long ago, the park was landscaped and the exit from this very park to the road was laid out of paving slabs. Unfortunately, the crossing from this exit was not secured by a pedestrian crossing. For many years, this section of the road has been the shortest way to get through the carriageway to the private sector of buildings and is very popular among the elderly and schoolchildren. The crossing with a traffic light, which was installed not far from this place, did not improve the situation, and people both crossed the road lower towards APZ-20 and still do it. I ask you to consider the option of installing a “Pedestrian crossing” sign and applying appropriate markings on this section in order to prevent possible accidents involving pedestrians, as well as to regulate the speed limit of vehicles that repeatedly exceed the speed limit on this section of the road at night, thereby exposing citizens to additional danger.

"Good afternoon! The essence of the problem is this, I am a resident of the village of Buklyata, Zolotukhinsky district, Kursk region. For a long time, there was no hard road surface (motor road) throughout the entire territory of the settlement, which made it very difficult to move to socially significant objects in the village of Zolotukhuno under adverse weather conditions. This problem was addressed by the villagers more than once, held meetings, collected signatures. The administration of the Zolotukhinsky district responded to the appeals of residents that the settlement was included in the list of objects on which it is planned to build a highway. And so it happened, by the Decree of 12/20/2018. No. 871-pa of the Administration of the Zolotukhinsky District of the Kursk Region “On Amendments to the Resolution of the Administration of the Zolotukhinsky District dated November 12, 2015. No. 555 “On approval of the municipal program of the Zolotukhinsky district of the Kursk region “Development of the transport system, ensuring the transportation of passengers in the Zolotukhinsky district of the Kursk region and road safety” `it was provided for the development and examination of design estimates for the construction of a highway to the village of Buklyata, Zolotukhinsky district in the Kursk region with a length of 3 km. In 2021 June 1, 2021 the contractor has started the preparatory stage of the road construction, namely the clearing and leveling of the territory. Our disappointment knew no bounds. As it turned out, the length of the road under construction is only 802 m, which will provide year-round access to houses No. 4-26, while houses No. 31 to No. 64, located on the opposite side of the stream, are completely devoid of road surface. In the autumn-spring period, houses remain cut off from the social facilities of Zolotukhino settlement. in autumn and spring, the stream floods and vehicles (including emergency vehicles) cannot pass. Residents are forced to get to the village of Zolotukhino on foot along the railway, which is not the safest route. With the commissioning of the highway for residents of buildings No. 31-64, nothing will change, and we will still be cut off from the settlement of Zolotukhino. When asked why the length of the road has decreased so much, the administration of the Zolotukhinsky district stated that some of the houses are located on the border of lands intended for the needs of the Russian Railways, and yes, it is, according to the public map of Rosreestr, the border passes through the land plots of houses No. 1-3, and I I admit that the construction of a highway in this place is unacceptable. One of the owners was offered to build a road directly on his site, to which he agreed, believing that this territory would be bought from him, but as it turned out, the administration planned to receive a land plot free of charge. After the announced decisions, the owner refused. Why is it impossible to implement a project of a 3 km highway from the side of houses No. 27-30 and cover the rest of the village, there are no barriers to construction in the indicated place. But the administration took the simplest path, and I am sure that with the commissioning of a section of the road with a length of 802 meters, when complaints are received from residents, they will report that there is a hard road surface throughout the village, which was put into operation in 2021.",0,False

"Hello. It was necessary to write this letter. We write anonymously, because We worry about the fate of the children. There is simply no strength to endure and worry about our children who study at the MBOU school No. 2 in Kursk, in the 4th “b” grade. Class teacher Bezhan Tatyana Konstantinovna. To call her a teacher, and even more so a teacher-psychologist, does not turn the tongue. We do not know how such an “employee” was allowed to enter primary school. At the end of the 4th grade, children will leave with a crippled psyche. And these are not empty words. Children constantly have to be persuaded to go to school, spend hours on it and calm them down. The associations of children with the school are the constant cries of the teacher. How is that possible? Bezhan T.K. regularly insults children, calls them “fools”, “morons”, “children of drunks” (all verbatim) and the list goes on. All parents will attest to this. He constantly yells at children, saying that they are not capable of anything and that they belong in a school for the mentally retarded. And we all know what kind of school it is. Does the primary school teacher really not understand that the child's psyche suffers? The question, of course, is rhetorical… Bezhan T.K. regularly disrupts classes, although the children have congenital malformations, for which there is absolutely no preparation! Several times a week, she cancels math, Russian, and other important classes. Instead, she conducts “explanatory”, as she believes, conversations with the children. With screams. Speaking with girls - about ""prostitutes"", and with boys - about ""convicts"". This is literally one of the examples. Discuss prostitution in 4th grade! What's going on in this teacher's head? Which believes that it is more important to discuss prostitution and the criminal world than to prepare children for CD. Once again, we want to focus on this - there is absolutely no preparation of children for CM. During the distance learning period, the classes were held as follows - in the morning the teacher sent a photo of a leaflet with what needed to be done, and in the evening the parents sent photos of the children's work. That's all. Is this what we were striving for? Is this our worthy education? Yesterday Bezhan T.K. went even further. She made the children stand 2 lessons. Remember, this is 4th grade. The children stood for two lessons and listened to educational conversations and cries ... instead of knowledge. And far from all the facts are described in this open letter. We ask you to deal with this situation, take this teacher under control, and better the whole school, because continue learning in it there is no desire. These words can be confirmed anonymously by all parents. Anonymous, because many are worried about the possible “bullying” of children.",7,False

"Hello, we all write and talk about only one thing: roads, hospitals, bad government, and so on. I have been following the communities of Kursk for a couple of years, but I have never seen anyone write and complain about mobile operators. In the cities of the Kursk region, there is practically no issue in servicing cellular communications, but the quality of service could still be improved in the 21st century. The problem appears at the exits from the city, namely on the highways of the region. Many friends are faced with such a problem: it is possible to get through only to number 112 and that's it. WHY IS THIS HAPPENING? We will not talk about any specific sections of roads, there is such a problem everywhere. Take, for example, roads such as: Kursk - Zheleznogorsk, Kursk - Oboyan, Kursk - Shchigry, Kursk - Lgov - Rylsk, Kursk - Sudzha, leaving Kursk in any direction, we are facing the communication problem of any operator `NO NETWORK`. Verified by personal experience. When we go, for example, in the direction of Moscow - St. Petersburg, the network is everywhere and always. The Kursk region is still making roads, repairing hospitals, etc. While someone is now standing on the road with a broken tire and cannot get through, or even worse, someone has become ill at the wheel and also cannot get through to their relatives and loved ones. So, give your opinion in the comments. I would very much like to receive a comment from the leaders of the Administration of the Kursk region who are in charge of this issue. Thank you for your attention. I think that many will support.

"Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin spoke more than once about the revival of villages. In the Zheleznogorsk district of the Kursk region, a merger of village councils took place. On the territory of the united Linetsky village council there are many villages, villages, farms, which are widely scattered within a radius of 7-15 km. Therefore, during the years of Soviet power, several schools were built on the territory of the united village councils. Years passed, young people from the village left for the city. There are few children left, and only 3 schools remain (Radubezhskaya secondary school, Linetskaya secondary school, Nizhnezhdanovskaya secondary school). The villages of the former Nizhnezhdanovsky s / s are the most remote from the regional center. The former leadership of the Fatezhsky district, which owned the Nizhnezhdanovsky and Linetsky s / s, set the task of reviving the villages. For this purpose, a village was built, gas was supplied, in 2007 (now s / s belonged to the Zheleznogorsk district) a new school was built. Everything in it meets modern requirements. There is a computer class, a workshop, a gym, a dining room are equipped. With the help of children and teachers at the school, a museum of military and labor glory of our fellow villagers was opened, a gallery of the Immortal Regiment was created. Children help take care of the monument to the fallen fellow villagers and know for sure that no one is forgotten and nothing is forgotten. Some graduates remained to serve in the Army on a contract basis, and are currently participating in a military special operation in the Donbass. And everything seemed to work out, young families with children settled in the village. But two schools of the Linetsky s / s were closed (Radubezhskaya secondary school and Linetskaya secondary school). A bus was allocated and children from these schools were taken to the new Nizhnezhdanovsk secondary school. In the 2022-2023 academic year, 51 children of the Linetsky s / s, out of 8 first-graders, should study here. And suddenly the Head of the Administration of the Zheleznogorsk region, Frolkov A.D. makes a decision on the reorganization of the school, referring to the instruction of the Education Committee of the Kursk region, where, allegedly, a decision was made to liquidate 5 schools of the Zheleznogorsk district. They want to expel the children, but where is the new building? Sell? Young families with children are outraged, many of them came to the village of Verkhnee Zhdanovo only because there is a school here. How is it possible to close all the schools of the united village councils and the theme is to cross out everything that has been done under the program for the revival of the village. Is our country really so poor that it cannot afford the maintenance of even one school in the territory of the united village councils. So the revival of the villages for the Linetsky s / s has ended, no school means no future. And in the village of Verkhnee Zhdanovo, the House of Culture, a kindergarten, and a post office have already been closed. Probably, the management wants to close the school in order to finally destroy the village.

The main problem is that when, for some reason, traffic is blocked on adjacent streets (Aerodromnaya or Fighters of the 9th Division) or a “traffic jam” forms on Khrushchev Avenue, drivers begin to look for passage through our dead end without slowing down. They do not limit the speed as there are no additional signs. All this makes it difficult not only to walk with small children, but even just to leave the house. Gates open outward rather than inward. In this dead end, children always gather and walk, as well as exits from houses are made right on this passage. The area is mostly retired. In fact, this is an extended sidewalk. I would like to solve this problem by installing a pedestrian zone sign or at least a speed limit sign or a “brick” sign.",0,False

"Hello. I am writing about a doctor from the perinatal center - Sapranova N.A. Iz-for it almost there was a miscarriage and a nervous breakdown! And I am silent about the rather large amount of money that I spent to double-check her conclusion on the ultrasound. I was given a referral at the LCD for the first screening in the opts to N.A. Sapranova on April 11, 2022. After this screening, my life was divided into before and after. The fact is that a year ago I was diagnosed with an endometrioid cyst, I treated it, and not a single doctor confirmed this diagnosis to me. Before the screening, the last ultrasound was on March 14 in the LCD. Everything was fine, I was confirmed pregnant and, of course, this cyst. At the screening, I told the doctor this information, to which, she answered me that it was necessary to remove the cyst, and in general I became pregnant only because I really want to get married. I just kept silent on this statement, although my personal life does not concern her. But these are all trifles compared to what happened next. When this doctor performed a gynecological ultrasound, she discussed with the nurse, one might even say in a joking way, that the last patient had no vices, like morning they didn’t have a problem, and she began to dictate to the nurse already according to my situation, and then again smile , and such an expression from the doctor “it would be better if there were only myomas today”, in the end I don’t understand anything, she doesn’t tell me anything and confidently asserted that my entire small pelvis is in metastases, then she called another doctor who is with her fully agreed. I started to panic, I ask what it threatens, to which I heard in a very rude form “you will talk with the oncologist, he will tell you what it threatens”, she also continued to joke with the nurse. Then she sent me to a gynecologist, and while I was sitting in line with a gynecologist, I had to read on the Internet what kind of diagnosis it was, I was shocked. And that's putting it mildly. There is cancer, namely peritoneal carcinomatosis, this is one of the most terrible types of cancer, if not the most terrible. The gynecologist gave a referral to the cancer center. They didn’t take me there right away, but they signed me up only for April 19, naturally, I wouldn’t have lived up to that time morally, I signed up for a paid ultrasound of the abdominal cavity, for re-screening. And the doctors to whom I showed the diagnosis from Sapranova were dumbfounded how it was possible to write such a thing on one study. When I underwent a second screening, the doctor told me that she had not only diagnosed me, but pronounced a sentence. That's where I got my tests done. But just to make sure that everything is fine with me, Just in case, I went to another clinic and did another screening. There, the doctor, of course, was also shocked by what he saw. And the most interesting thing is that not a single doctor saw metastases, although she claimed that I had absolutely everything in metastases. Then I went to the oncology center, to the oncogynecologist, it so happened that they accepted me earlier. This doctor was also in shock, like the previous 4. She said that it was a rather high-profile diagnosis, she made me, looked at all my screenings and gave a referral for ultrasound to the oncology center, where I had an ultrasound and another doctor was shocked by Sapranova's diagnosis. I was confirmed with an endometriosis cyst, all the doctors, except for Sapranova, everyone asked me the question, where are the metastases ???? But now I would very much like to personally ask this doctor of the highest category. It's hard for me to call her a doctor after that, I find it hard to even call her human. What I experienced, I would not wish this on anyone. I am really very interested in how a doctor of the highest category cannot distinguish a cyst from cancer, and also why out of many doctors in Kursk, only she sees metastases? Does she have some special vision?",4,False

Children in the middle of the night are frightened when some kind of reckless driver, spitting on warning signs, rushes headlong, and we are not only talking about cars. If you want to, so that the rules are observed there, and do not exceed the speed, then be so kind as to hang the camera, but remove the artificial unevenness! Cameras were installed in the inns, and there it is about 50 meters from the road to residential buildings, and on the Embankment from 5-10 meters. I really hope that you hear us and get them out of there. We look forward to resolving this issue as soon as possible.",0,False

"Complaint about the organization of public transport along the route ""Bus station - settlement named after M. Zhukov"". Drivers do not follow the route schedule. Despite the mask regime introduced in the region, they almost never wear masks. There are no terminals for payment by bank cards in transport. Drivers are often rude to passengers, when they try to pay off with banknotes of more than 500 rubles, they throw change at a person. The minibus has a complaint number +74994995373, when calling which, instead of accepting citizens' appeals, they simply justify the actions of the drivers and claim that the passengers themselves are to blame.

"Good afternoon! I would like to clarify when the laying of the road surface will begin along Gagarin Street in the village of Yasenki (at the moment the road is unpaved). In addition, I would like to draw attention to the quality of work. For example, the pavement along Sadovaya Street in the village of Yasenki, laid earlier, is in poor condition, no repairs have been carried out during the operation.

"Hello!! On my own behalf and on behalf of the residents of St. Chulkova Gora 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13 I am making a huge request for help in resolving the issue of asphalt pavement. On our street in the area of ​​\u200b\u200bhouse 9 there is a drain pit for rainwater. The road has not been repaired for more than 5 years. Heavy rains that took place on 07/02/2021 raised all the asphalt, runoff water went under the asphalt into the yards and gardens of the indicated households. Thus, the next rainfall will not go to the drain pit for its intended purpose, but to the courtyards of private houses of local residents. At present, with the naked eye, one can see the channel of the passing runoff waters and the exposed asphalt pavement, incl. courtyard areas. In addition, more than 2 weeks ago, a metal grate `disappeared` from the drain pit. The pit is open, which is a source of increased danger.",0,False
